Milton Babbitt said of her \"She manages to learn music no one else in the world can. She can work, work, work.\" In a 1961 interview for Newsweek, Beardslee flaunted her unflinching repertoire and disdain for commercialism: \"I don't think in terms of the public... Music is for the musicians. If the public wants to come along and study it, fine. I don't go and try to tell a scientist his business because I don't know anything about it. Music is just the same way. Music is \"not\" entertainment.\"\n\nNeil Mackie: \nNeil Mackie (born 1946) is a Scottish tenor.

He wrote 36 motets (published in 1613) and 16 surviving masses (1631).

About twenty years earlier Bruckner had already composed a song on the same text.\n\nLuigi Lamberti: \nLuigi Lamberti (22 October 1769 \u2013 after 1812) was an Italian composer of operas and other pieces. He was born in Savona and, like Francesco Gnecco, he studied with Mariani, the \"maestro di capella\" of the Savona cathedral. Once his master died, he succeeded to the position. However, he was said to be of a \"restless spirit\" and abandoned the position. Moving to Paris in 1806, he published a number of compositions dedicated to princess Pauline Bonaparte. In Italy, he composed the operas \"Orfeo\" (1796), \"L' Amante Schernito\", and \"I Due Fratelli Originali\". He was prolific.

The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies.\n\nFranz Asplmayr: \nFranz Asplmayr (1 April 1728 \u2013 29 July 1786) was an Austrian composer and violinist.

He is best known for an opera on Greek myths, and for a few symphonies and string trios of his which were attributed to Joseph Haydn at one time. Among the few scholars who have studied his music, there are many differing opinions as to the quality. J. Murray Barbour, for one, deems Asplmayr's 80 minuets \"scored mostly for oboes, horns, and strings, without violas,\" that \"all are extremely boring, as if written between beers.\" Temperly, on the other hand, finds advances \"with respect to harmony and developmental techniques.\"\n\nCristiano Giuseppe Lidarti: \nCristiano Giuseppe Lidarti (Vienna 23 February 1730 \u2013 Pisa 1795) was an Austrian composer, born in Vienna of Italian descent.

WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates\u2014apart from WLOB\u2014of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show. WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18\u00bc hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET). In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk. In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air).\n\nWHP (AM): \nWHP (580 AM, \"NewsRadio WHP 580\") is a commercial AM radio station licensed to serve Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by iHeartMedia through licensee Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc and broadcasts a talk radio format. The station's transmitter and six tower (directional) antenna array are located in East Pennsboro Township near Enola, Pennsylvania. WHP's signal is non-directional during daytime hours and is directed southeastward toward Harrisburg and Lancaster at night.\n\nCIRR-FM: \nCIRR-FM, branded as 103.9 Proud FM, is a radio station in Toronto, Ontario, licensed to serve the city's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities, launched in 2007. It is the first radio station in Canada targeted specifically to an LGBT audience, and the first commercial terrestrial LGBT radio station in the world \u2014 all earlier LGBT radio stations, such as Joy Melbourne in Australia, Radio Rosa in Denmark and SIRIUS OutQ on satellite radio, were operated by community non-profit groups or aired on non-traditional radio platforms.\n\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania: \nHarrisburg (Pennsylvania German: \"Harrisbarrig\") is the capital city of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States, and the county seat of Dauphin County. With a population of 48,904, it is the ninth-largest city in the Commonwealth. It lies on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, 107 mi west of Philadelphia.\n\nWSTU: \nWSTU (1450 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a talk radio format. Licensed to Stuart, Florida, United States, the station is currently owned by Treasure Coast Broadcasters, Inc. WSTU went on the air in December 1954. Les Combs was the original owner. In 1969 the station was sold to Harvey L Glascock, whose family owned the station until 1997 when it was sold to American Radio. After a brief ownership by a Broward County businessman, it was sold to Barry Grant Marsh and David Pomerance. Marsh had been Operations Manager of WSTU for many years under the Glasscock family. The station was purchased by Treasure Coast Broadcasters in 2001. When WSTU went on the air, Stuart went from the biggest city on Florida's east coast without its own radio station to the smallest city on Florida's east coast with its own radio station.\n---------------------\nDarwinia (plant): \nDarwinia, sometimes commonly known as mountain bells or simply bells, is a genus of about 70 species of evergreen shrubs in the family Myrtaceae, endemic to southeastern and southwestern Australia. The majority are native to southern Western Australia, but a few species occur in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. The genus was named in honour of Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin by Edward Rudge in 1816. Most darwinias grow to a height of between 0.2 and 3 m and many are prostrate shrubs. Most have small, simple leaves and the flowers are often grouped together, each flower with five red, white or greenish petals and ten stamens. In many species, the flowers are surrounded by large, colourful bracts, giving rise to their common names.\n\nSideroxylon salicifolium: \nSideroxylon salicifolium, commonly called white bully or willow bustic, is a species of flowering plant native to Florida, the West Indies and Central America. It has also been considered a member of the genus \"Dipholis\", with the binomial \"Dipholis salicifolia\". Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin \"salix\" 'willow' and \"folia\" 'leaf'.\n\nVerticordia sect. Elachoschista: \nVerticordia\" sect. \"Elachoschista is one of eleven sections in the subgenus \"Verticordia\". It includes a single species in the genus \"Verticordia\". Plants in this section resemble those in section \"Infuscata\" except that the sepal lobes are not divided but may have an irregularly toothed edge. Plants in this section superficially resemble some of the smaller \"Darwinia\" species. The leaves are crowded and the flower are cream-coloured, turning greenish-brown as they age. When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia. The name \"Elachoschista\" is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"elachys\" meaning \"little\" and \"schizo\" meaning \"cut\" referring to the sepals which have almost smooth edges.\n\nCalliergon cordifolium: \nCalliergon cordifolium is a species of moss in the Amblystegiaceae family commonly known as the calliergon moss (though this name refers to the genus \"Calliergon\" generally) or heart-leaved spearmoss. The species is abundant in the right habitat, and grows in marshes and wet woodland, especially woodland of alder (\"Alnus\") or willow (\"Salix\"), as well as around streams, ditches and pools. The species grows in tufts among other moss species. \"Calliergon cordifolium\" requires a wet environment to grow, and often grows completely submerged in water. It typically prefers lowland, but has been recorded as high as 910 m above sea level in Inverness, Scotland. The species has a circumpolar Boreo-temperate distribution. It is found throughout Europe (including north, into the Arctic Circle - Svalbard, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland - and east into the Caucasus). It has been recorded in north and central Asia, as well as Turkey and Japan, throughout North America and in New Zealand.\n\nMarsh tit: \nThe marsh tit (\"Poecile palustris\") is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae and genus \"Poecile\", closely related to the willow, P\u00e8re David's and Songar tits. It is small (around 12\u00a0cm long and weighing 12 g) with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail. Between 8 and 11 subspecies are recognised. This bird's close resemblance to the willow tit can cause identification problems, especially in the United Kingdom where the local subspecies of the two are very similar (there, they were not recognised as separate species until 1897).\n\nInocybe salicis: \nInocybe salicis is an uncommon species of fungus found in association with willow in Europe. The species produces small, brown or yellow mushrooms with caps up to 2.5 cm across, with stems up to 3.5 cm long. The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus \"Inocybe\" that also associate with willow, and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically.\n---------------------\nIt is small (around 12\u00a0cm long and weighing 12 g) with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail.

The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus \"Inocybe\" that also associate with willow, and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically.\n\nWillow: \nWillows, also called sallows, and osiers, form the genus Salix, around 400 species of deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow (from Old English \"sealh\", related to the Latin word \"salix\", willow). Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (\"Salix herbacea\") rarely exceeds 6 cm in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.\n\nBarkleyanthus: \nBarkleyanthus is a monotypic genus. of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, containing the single species Barklyanthus salicifolius, a plant formerly classified in the genus \"Senecio\" It is native to North and Central America, where its distribution extends from the southwestern United States to El Salvador. Its common names include willow ragwort, willow groundsel, Barkley's-ragwort, and jarilla.\n\nSalix warburgii: \nSalix warburgii is a plant of the genus \"Salix\", the willows, endemic to Taiwan. It can be found among shrubs near water. growing 15 m tall. Liliaceae is the most fortunate plant in the vascular plant. It can live the most northern where is in the polar environment. In the tropical edge of the formation of endemic species in Taiwan is the reason for the rapid evolution of species in a special environment. The evolution of the results of the time and space, In addition to water willow outside the southeastern China's other multi-stamens willow and the four sub-Liu will have a similar situation, and these special willow plants are also known as tropical willow. Salix warburgii in Taiwan's distribution is low Elevation of the shrub and the river bank, because the cutting method is easy to survive so there is no artificial introduction of cultivation.\n\nDarwinia diosmoides: \nDarwinia diosmoides is a shrub which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It usually grows to between 0.3 and 1.2 metres in height and produces white flowers. The species was formally described in 1828 by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who gave it the name \"Genetyllis diosmoides\". It was transferred to the genus \"Darwinia\" in 1865 by English botanist George Bentham.\n---------------------\nWhite-bellied goshawk: \nThe white-bellied goshawk (\"Accipiter haplochrous\") is a species of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is endemic to New Caledonia. The species is also known as the New Caledonia goshawk or New Caledonia sparrowhawk.\n\nNew Caledonian thicketbird: \nThe New Caledonia thicketbird or New Caledonia grassbird (\"Megalurulus mariei\"), is a bird species. Previously placed in the \"Old World warbler\" family Sylviidae, it does not seem to be a close relative of the typical warblers; probably it belongs in the grass warbler family Locustellidae. This species is endemic to New Caledonia.\n\nNew Caledonian legislative election, 2009: \nParliamentary elections were held in New Caledonia on 10 May 2009. Voters in New Caledonia chose 76 candidates for the French territory's three provincial assemblies. Fifty-four of these 76 members were also to become members of the Congress of New Caledonia. Members of the Congress of New Caledonia serve 5-year terms in office upon their election.\n\nBurretiokentia: \nBurretiokentia is a genus of palms (Arecaceae) endemic to New Caledonia containing five species. The relationships between Burretiokentia and some other genera of the tribe Basseliniinae including \"Physokentia\" and the New Caledonia endemic \"Cyphophoenix\" are not clear.\n\nDiane Bui Duyet: \nDiane Bui Duyet, sometimes spelled \"Bui-Duyet\", (born 22 December 1979 in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia) is a French/New Caledonian swimmer. Due to the New Caledonia's status as an overseas territory of France, Bui Duyet competes for New Caledonia in regional (Pacific) competitions and for France in continental and above competitions (similar to Malia Metella's situation with French Guiana). At the 2007 and 2011 Pacific Games, Bui Duyet swam on several relay teams together with Lara Grangeon, who also represents both France and New Caledonia.\n\nPhysokentia: \nPhysokentia is a genus of flowering plant in the palm family, native to certain islands of the western Pacific. It contains the following species: The relationships between Physokentia and some other genera of the tribe Basseliniinae particularly the New Caledonia endemic \"Burretiokentia\" and \"Cyphophoenix\" are not clear.\n\nList of birds of New Caledonia: \nThis is a list of the bird species recorded in New Caledonia. The avifauna of New Caledonia include a total of 189 species, of which 23 are endemic, 14 have been introduced by humans and 48 are rare or accidental. Three species listed are extirpated in New Caledonia and are not included in the species count. Twelve species are globally threatened.\n\nOlivier Saminadin: \nOlivier Saminadin (born 6 September 1977) is a French swimmer from New Caledonia. Due to New Caledonia's status as an overseas territory of France, and its current lack of official recognition by the International Olympic Committee, Saminadin (like other swimmers from New Caledonia, such as Diane Bui Duyet), swims for New Caledonia in regional (Pacific) competition, and for France in continental and above championships.\n\nAraucaria subulata: \nAraucaria subulata (narrow-leaf araucaria) is a species of conifer in the Araucariaceae family. It is found only in New Caledonia, with scattered populations present across the central and southern mountain regions of the main island Grande Terre, especially on Mont Dzumac and Mont des Sources. It is one of the tallest of New Caledonia's endemic araucaria species, reaching up to 50 meters in height. It is threatened by habitat loss as with all of New Caledonia's araucaria trees, but populations of \"Araucaria subulata\" are currently considered to be stable and it was not found to be threatened or endangered when most recently assessed.\n\nBletilla: \nBletilla, common name urn orchid, is a temperate, terrestrial genus of orchids containing five currently recognized species distributed through China, Japan, Taiwan, south to Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar.\n---------------------\nDiplocyclos: \nDiplocyclos is a genus of climbing or trailing vine in the family Cucurbitaceae. The genus comprises four or five species. \"D. palmatus\" is pantropical in distribution and the remainder of species are restricted to Africa. All species are found within rainforest and the moister woodland types.\n\nGrapevine virus A: \nGrape vine virus A (GVA) is a plant virus and the type species in the genus \"Vitivirus\".\n\nAnnual growth cycle of grapevines: \nThe annual growth cycle of grapevines is the process that takes place in the vineyard each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital role in the development of grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.\n\nDiplocyclos palmatus: \nDiplocyclos palmatus is a vine in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is commonly known as Native Bryony or Striped cucumber.\n\nChampanel (grape): \nThe Champanel grape is an American hybrid developed by Thomas Volney Munson of Texas. Champanel is a cross of the two grape varieties Vitis champini X Worden, a Concord seedling. It grows vigorusly, is resistant to root rot, Pierces disease and produces clusters of fruit resistant to rot and mildew. Although well adapted to a wide range of growing conditions, Chanpanel produces fruit with aroma characteristic of its Concord perantage and is not often seen commercially. Rather, Champanel is most often used as grafting material for Vitis vinifera (wine grapes), to provide disease resistant root stock. Jim Kamas writes, \"Although the cause of vine death from [Pierce disease] was not known to him, T.V. Munson realized that utilizing grape parents that survived local conditions was important in creating new, improved adapted grape varieties\" (Power). Munson not only developed a hybrid grape that is resistant to Pierce disease but that grows well in any soil type. The Champanel grapevine grows vigorously on any type of trellis it is placed under. The vine can be placed beside a fence so that the arms of the vine can run along it. Even though the vine grows vigorously, the Champanel grapevine is great for first time growers who want to add grapevines to their garden for the berries or for aesthetics. With the berries a grower can make jelly, juice or wine. This vine is excellent for growing up an arbor to provide shade in a growers back or front yard.\n\nTromboncino (squash): \nTromboncino (] ), also known as zucchetta (] ), is a type of squash most often used as a summer squash. While nearly all summer squash are cultivars of \"Cucurbita pepo\", tromboncino is a cultivar of \"Cucurbita moschata\". The vining growth habit, is similar to many winter squashes, but unlike most other summer squash. It is more tolerant to some common summer squash pests, including squash vine borer, squash bugs, and powdery mildew, than the more commonly grown, bushy, \"C. pepo\" summer squash cultivars. The plants are slower to start producing than some \"C. pepo\" types. The fruit color is usually pale green, fading to beige upon maturity, and it is picked around one foot long for summer squash. It is an heirloom, originally from Liguria, and remains popular throughout Italy and abroad. Tromboncino squash can be left to mature into a winter squash; such is often compared to a watery butternut squash. If left to ripen, the fruits can grow over three feet in length.\n\nAmpelocissus africana: \nAmpelocissus africana is a type of vine that is woody, or liana of the grape family, bearing edible fruit.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        Ravenscroft lies on a plateau that goes through which US states?\n        \n        assistant\n         Tennessee.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
