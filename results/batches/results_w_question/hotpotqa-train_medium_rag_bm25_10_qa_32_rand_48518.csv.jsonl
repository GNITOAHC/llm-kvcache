The music score was composed by Alan Silvestri.\n\nA Christmas Carol (soundtrack): \nA Christmas Carol is a soundtrack for the 2009 film of the same name. The music was composed by Alan Silvestri with some of the music being based on actual carols. The album was later issued physically through Intrada Records. The theme song \"God Bless Us Everyone\" was written by Silvestri and Glen Ballard and performed by Italian classical crossover tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nWhoa, Nelly!: \nWhoa, Nelly! is the debut studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado. It was released in North America on October 24, 2000 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at number twenty-four on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and opened to critical acclaim. It produced three international singles: \"I'm Like a Bird\", \"Turn Off the Light\" and \"...on the Radio (Remember the Days)\". \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" was a club-only single released exclusively in the US before the album's availability in stores, and it was included on the soundtrack of the 1999 film \"Brokedown Palace\". When \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" was released, Furtado's label was unsure about the genre in which to market her. They eventually remixed \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" and included it on this album as \"Party\". The DreamWorks label released \"Trynna Finda Way\" as the fourth single in Mexico and South America, and \"Hey, Man!\" as the fourth single in the UK and Germany.\n---------------------\nJukebox musical: \nA jukebox musical is a stage or film musical that uses previously released popular songs as its musical score. Usually the songs have a connection with a particular popular musician or group\u2014because they were either written by, or for, the artists in question, or at least covered by them. The songs are contextualized into a dramatic plot: often the biographical story of the performer(s) whose music is featured, although in some cases the plot does not revolve around the particular group at all.\n\nCyrano, el musical: \nCyrano, el musical is a Mexican musical based on the play \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" by Edmond Rostand. The book and lyrics are by Lorenzo Gonzalez. The music is by David Tort. It was the first Mexican musical written in verse, based upon the Spanish translation from the French.\n\nMariana Trevi\u00f1o: \nMariana Trevi\u00f1o is a Mexican stage and screen actress from Monterrey. She became known to a wider domestic audience through her role as Lupita in the popular jukebox musical \"Mentiras\", which she played in over a thousand performances. Following the success of Mentiras, Trevi\u00f1o went on to appear in Mexican comedy films such as \"No s\u00e9 si cortarme las venas o dej\u00e1rmelas largas\" (2013) and \"Amor de Mis Amores\" (2014). As of 2015, she co-stars with Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez in Netflix' first ever Spanish-language original production \"Club de Cuervos\". Trevi\u00f1o received two nominations at the 59th Ariel Award for Best Supporting Actress for \"La Vida Inmoral de la Pareja Ideal\", and Best Actress in a Minor Role for \"El Sue\u00f1o del Mara'akame\".\n\nCalamity Jane (musical): \nCalamity Jane (A Musical Western) is a stage musical based on the historical figure of frontierswoman Calamity Jane. The non-historical, somewhat farcical plot involves the authentic Calamity Jane's professional associate Wild Bill Hickok, and presents the two as having a contentious relationship that ultimately proves to be a facade for mutually amorous feelings. The \"Calamity Jane\" stage musical originated as a live adaption of \"Calamity Jane\", the 1953 Warner Bros. movie musical with Doris Day.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        Who directed the film for which Aerosmith performed the song \"Sweet Emotion\"? \n        \n        assistant\n         Michael Bay directed the film \"Armageddon\" for which Aerosmith performed the song \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", not \"Sweet Emotion\".\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
