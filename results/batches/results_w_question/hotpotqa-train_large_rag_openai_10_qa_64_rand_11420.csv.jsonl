In terms of statistical significance and success rate, the study outperformed similar studies of other psychological interventions for chronic back pain.\n\nMicrocredit: \nMicrocredit is the extension of very small loans (microloans) to impoverished borrowers who typically lack collateral, steady employment and a verifiable credit history. It is designed to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. Many recipients are illiterate, and therefore unable to complete paperwork required to get conventional loans. As of 2009 an estimated 74 million people held microloans that totaled US$38 billion. Grameen Bank reports that repayment success rates are between 95 and 98 percent.\n\nMarketing assistance loans: \nMarketing assistance loans are nonrecourse loans made available to producers of loan commodities (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley oats, upland and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton, rice, soybeans, other oilseeds, honey, wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas) under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1201-1205). The new law largely continued the commodity loan programs as they were under previous law. Loan rate caps are specified in the law. Marketing loan repayment provisions apply when market prices drop below the loan rates. For farmers who forgo the use of marketing assistance loans, loan deficiency payment (LDP) rules apply (but not for ELS cotton).\n\nMarketing loan repayment provisions: \nIn United States agricultural policy, a marketing loan repayment provision is a loan settlement provision, first authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198), that allowed producers to repay nonrecourse loans at less than the announced loan rates whenever the world price or loan repayment rate for the commodity were less than the loan rate. Marketing loan provisions became mandatory for soybeans and other oilseeds, upland cotton, and rice and were permitted for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, and honey under amendments made by the 1990 farm bill (P.L. 101-624). The 1996 farm bill (P.L.\n---------------------\nMarketing loan repayment provisions apply when market prices drop below the loan rates.

CRS-161 101-171, Sec. 1201-1205) continued marketing assistance loans and expanded their application to wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas.\n\nStudent loan: \nA student loan is a type of loan designed to help students pay for post-secondary education and the associated fees, such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses. It may differ from other types of loans in that the interest rate may be substantially lower and the repayment schedule may be deferred while the student is still in school. It also differs in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. This article highlights the differences of the student loan system in several major countries.\n\nLoan: \nIn finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.\n\nPrivate student loan (United States): \nA private student loan is a financing option for higher education in the United States that can supplement, but should not replace, federal loans, such as Stafford loans, Perkins loans and PLUS loans. Private loans, which are heavily advertised, do not have the forbearance and deferral options available with federal loans (which are never advertised). In contrast with federal subsidized loans, interest accrues while the student is in college, although repayment may not begin until after graduation. While unsubsidized federal loans do have interest charges while the student is studying, private student loan rates are higher, sometimes much higher. Fees vary greatly, and legal cases have reported fees reaching 50% of amount of the loan. Although traditionally unsecured, these loans are increasingly secured, so that the borrower must offer collateral or a third-party guarantee of repayment.\n---------------------\nIt established that, in English trusts law, third parties could be liable for a breach of trust in two circumstances, referred to as the two 'limbs' of \"Barnes v Addy\": knowing receipt and knowing assistance.\n\nDishonest assistance: \nDishonest assistance, or knowing assistance, is a type of third party liability under English trust law. It is usually seen as one of two liabilities established in \"Barnes v Addy,\" the other one being knowing receipt. To be liable for dishonest assistance, there must be a breach of trust or fiduciary duty by someone other than the defendant, the defendant must have helped that person in the breach, and the defendant must have a dishonest state of mind. The liability itself is well established, but the mental element of dishonesty is subject to considerable controversy which sprang from the House of Lords case \"Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley\".\n\nDemutualization: \nDemutualization is the process by which a customer-owned mutual organization (\"mutual\") or co-operative changes legal form to a joint stock company. It is sometimes called stocking or privatization. As part of the demutualization process, members of a mutual usually receive a \"windfall\" payout, in the form of shares in the successor company, a cash payment, or a mixture of both. Mutualization or mutualisation is the opposite process, wherein a shareholder-owned company is converted into a mutual organization, typically through takeover by an existing mutual organization. Furthermore, re-mutualization depicts the process of aligning or refreshing the interest and objectives of the members of the mutual society.\n\nMichigan v. EPA: \nMichigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, 576 U.S. ___ (2015), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court analyzed whether the Environmental Protection Agency must consider costs when deciding to regulate, rather than later in the process of issuing the regulation. Writing for a 5\u20134 majority, Justice Antonin Scalia held that the EPA must consider costs and that it interpreted the Clean Air Act unreasonably when it determined that it did not need to consider costs when it issued a \"finding\" that it was \"necessary and appropriate\" to regulate. Critics of the Environmental Protection Agency praised the Court's decision, while other commentators criticized Justice Scalia's decision to ignore health impacts in his opinion. Some commentators suggested that the decision may derail President Barack Obama's climate change agenda entirely.\n\nMutual organization: \nA mutual, mutual organization, or mutual society is an organization (which is often, but not always, a company or business) based on the principle of mutuality. Unlike a true cooperative, members usually do not contribute to the capital of the company by direct investment, but derive their right to profits and votes through their customer relationship. A mutual organization or society is often simply referred to as \"a mutual\".\n---------------------\nIt has an area of 4,475,757 km2, and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\n\nACP\u2013EU development cooperation: \nDevelopment cooperation between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007. Although bilateral relations have always been and still remain one of the main features of modern development cooperation, it was the Treaty of Rome in 1957 which first established a collective European development policy. The Treaty of Rome granted associated status to 31 overseas collectivities and territories (OCTs) and provided for the creation of a European Development Fund (EDF) intended to grant technical and financial assistance to the countries which were still under European rule at the time. More significantly, however, by means of the Treaty of Rome the six member states of the European Economic Community were expressing solidarity with the colonies and OCTs and committed themselves to contribute to their prosperity. The EDF has to date been funded outside the EU budget by the EU Member States on the basis of financial payments related to specific contribution shares, or \u201ckeys\u201d, which are subject to negotiation. The EDF is currently the only EU policy instrument that is financed through a specific key that is different from the EU budget key, and which reflects the comparative interests of individual Member States.\n\nEuropean Union value added tax: \nThe European Union value added tax (or EU VAT) is a value added tax on goods and services within the European Union (EU). The EU's institutions do not collect the tax, but EU member states are each required to adopt a value added tax that complies with the EU VAT code. Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states, ranging from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary. The total VAT collected by member states is used as part of the calculation to determine what each state contributes to the \"EU's budget\".\n\nPIGS (economics): \nPIGS or PIIGS or PIIGGS is an acronym used in economics and finance. The PIGS acronym originally refers, often derogatorily, to the economies of the Southern European countries of Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. During the European debt crisis, the term was also increasingly used to refer to the economies of Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain, four EU member states that were unable to refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks on their own during the crisis.\n\nEurodac: \nEuropean Dactyloscopy (EuroDac) is the European Union (EU) fingerprint database for identifying asylum seekers and irregular border-crossers. Asylum applicants and irregular border-crossers over the age of 14 have their fingerprints taken as a matter of European Community law. These are then sent in digitally to a central unit at the European Commission, and automatically checked against other prints on the database. This enables authorities to determine whether asylum seekers have already applied for asylum in another EU member state or have illegally transited through another EU member state (\"principle of first contact\"). The Automated Fingerprint Identification System is the first of its kind on the European Union level and has been operating since 15 January 2003. All EU member states currently participate in the scheme, plus three additional European countries: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.\n\nEuropean debt crisis: \nThe European debt crisis (often also referred to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n---------------------\nEnlargement of the eurozone: \nThe enlargement of the eurozone is an ongoing process within the European Union (EU). All member states of the European Union, except Denmark and the United Kingdom which negotiated opt-outs from the provisions, are obliged to adopt the euro as their sole currency once they meet the criteria, which include: complying with the debt and deficit criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact, keeping inflation and long-term governmental interest rates below certain reference values, stabilizing their currency's exchange rate versus the euro by participating in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), and ensuring that their national laws comply with the ECB statute, ESCB statute and of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The obligation for EU member states to adopt the euro was first outlined by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which became binding on all new member states by the terms of their treaties of accession.\n\nSigning of the Treaty of Lisbon: \nThe signing of the Treaty of Lisbon took place in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13 December 2007. The Government of Portugal, by virtue of holding Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time, arranged a ceremony inside the 15th century Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, the same place Portugal's treaty of accession to the European Union (EU) had been signed in 1985. Representatives from the 27 EU member states were present, and signed the Treaty as plenipotentiaries, marking the end of negotiations that began in 2001. In addition, for the first time an EU treaty was also signed by the presidents of the three main EU institutions. After the main ceremony, the heads of state and government took a ride on a decorated Lisbon tram together, symbolising the brotherhood of European countries on the path of European integration.\n\nOperation Triton: \nOperation Triton is a border security operation conducted by Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. The operation, under Italian control, began on 1 November 2014 and involves voluntary contributions from 15 other European nations (both EU member states and non-members). Current voluntary contributors to Operation Triton are Croatia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Malta. The operation was undertaken after Italy ended Operation Mare Nostrum, which had become too costly for a single country to fund; it was costing the Italian government \u20ac9 million per month for an operation that lasted 12 months. The Italian government had requested additional funds from the other EU member states but they did not offer the requested support.\n\nEuropean Central Bank: \nThe European Central Bank (ECB; German: \"Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank (EZB)\", French: \"Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne (BCE)\") is the central bank for the euro and administers monetary policy of the eurozone, which consists of 19 EU member states and is one of the largest currency areas in the world. It is one of the world's most important central banks and is one of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) listed in the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The capital stock of the bank is owned by the central banks of all 28 EU member states. The Treaty of Amsterdam established the bank in 1998, and it is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. s of 2015 the President of the ECB is Mario Draghi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, former member of the World Bank, and former managing director of the Goldman Sachs international division (2002\u20132005). The bank primarily occupied the Eurotower prior to, and during, the construction of the new headquarters.\n\nEuropean Union: \nThe European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of 4,475,757 km2, and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\n\nACP\u2013EU development cooperation: \nDevelopment cooperation between the European Union (EU) and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007.\n---------------------\nLexa (The 100): \nLexa is a fictional character from the American post-apocalyptic science fiction television series \"The 100\", produced by The CW. The recurring television character (portrayed by Alycia Debnam-Carey) does not appear in the books on which the series is based. The commander of the allied Grounder clans, Lexa is proven to be a reasonable leader and strong warrior. She considers love a weakness, a view significantly impacted by the death of her girlfriend, Costia. Though she starts to show romantic feelings for Clarke Griffin (leader of the Sky People) and takes Clarke's views into consideration, Lexa puts her people first, even at the expense of losing Clarke's trust.\n\nTerminator Salvation: \nTerminator Salvation is a 2009 American post-apocalyptic science fiction war film directed by McG, starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. It is the fourth installment of the \"Terminator\" film series. In a departure from the previous installments, which were set between 1984 and 2004 and used time travel as a key plot element, \"Salvation\" is a post-apocalyptic film set in the year 2018, fourteen years after the events of \"\".

The shrine houses a stone statue of Kume no Heinai, a samurai from the early Edo period (17th century). According to the Asakusa tourism bureau, there are few facts about the life of Kume no Heinai, but he is said to have died in 1683. Oral tradition holds that Heinai excelled in Kenjutsu, the martial art of swordsmanship, killing many people over the years. In the latter half of his life, he is said to have lived in the Sens\u014d-ji temple in Asakusa where he devoted himself to Zen-Buddhism and held religious services in honor of the people he killed. Shortly before his death he ordered his followers to carve his likeness on a stone and bury it near the Ni\u014dmon \u2013 the entrance to the Buddhist temple and a busy district in the city. His wish was to have his statue be stepped on by as many people as possible in order to expiate the crimes he committed in life. The statue was eventually retrieved and is now stored inside the shrine itself. It is because of this that the shrine initially carried the name \"Fumitsuke\" (\u8e0f\u307f\u3064\u3051 ), which means \"to tread on\", but over time the meaning was lost and the shrine's name came to be spelled \u6587\u4ed8\u3051, which means \"love letter\". Both words are pronounced \"Fumitsuke\" and the shrine is now worshipped by the general public as a deity of marriage and match-making. Kume no Heinai-d\u014d was destroyed in March 1945 during World War II. The current temple was rebuilt in October 1978.\n\nGreece on the Ruins of Missolonghi: \nGreece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (French: \"La Gr\u00e8ce sur les ruines de Missolonghi\" ) is an 1826 oil painting by French painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and now preserved at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux.
