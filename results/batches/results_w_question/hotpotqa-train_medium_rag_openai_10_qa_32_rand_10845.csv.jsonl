Established in memory of US physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the award consisted of a medal, certificate and a $1000 honorarium. It was awarded for \"outstanding contributions to the theoretical natural sciences [...] during the preceding decade\".\n\nOppenheimer security hearing: \nThe Oppenheimer security hearing was a 1954 proceeding by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American scientist who had headed the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, where he played a key part in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb. The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's Q clearance being revoked. This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist McCarthyism.\n\nUranium hydride bomb: \nThe uranium hydride bomb was a variant design of the atomic bomb that was first suggested by Robert Oppenheimer in 1939 and advocated and tested by Edward Teller.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        In which film did the father of Rocky Iaukea appear?\n        \n        assistant\n         The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
