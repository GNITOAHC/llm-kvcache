The American team won six gold medals and a total of 18 medals together, both the most by any nation.

From 1912 to 1992, the events took place in more than one venue. Since the 1992 Summer Olympics, the equestrian events have taken place on a single venue in an effort to reduce costs. During the 1964 to the 1980 Summer Olympics, an equestrian event was the final event before the closing ceremonies of the respective Olympics. The last equestrian event that took place at the main stadium was at the 1988 Summer Olympics though it was not the final event before the closing ceremonies. That honor would fall for the end of the men's marathon event.

South Korea hosted its first World Championships in 1978 in shooting sports. Three years later, Seoul was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympics. Many of the venues constructed for the 1988 Games were completed two years earlier in time for the Asian Games. The 1986 Asian Games served as test events for the 1988 Summer Olympics. The men's marathon course was lined by 36,000\u00a0 policemen. Steffi Graf won a gold medal in women's singles to complete the \"Golden Slam\".
