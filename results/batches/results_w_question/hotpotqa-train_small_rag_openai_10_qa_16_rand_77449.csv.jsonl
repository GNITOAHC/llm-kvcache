In January 1972, Jones and Thomas formed a trio with their flatmate Bill Watkins (guitar, vocals, fiddle) and performed occasionally (unpaid) under various band names in Edinburgh folk clubs. In the spring of 1972, Watkins returned to Birmingham and, in June 1972, Chris Pritchard (vocals) came in as his replacement. In July 1972, this newly formed trio were offered their first paid booking at the Burns Monument Hotel, Brig O' Doune, Scotland, and needed a band name in a hurry. The name \"Silly Wizard\" was chosen and the continuing stream of bookings ensured that the name became permanent. In September 1972, the trio recruited a rather youthful Johnny Cunningham (1957-2003) (fiddle, viola, mandola, vocals) and Silly Wizard started to take off...\n\nList of original names of bands: \nMany notable bands originally went by different names before their mainstream breakthrough. This list of original names of bands list only former official band names that are significantly different from the eventual \"famous\" name. This list does not include former band names that have only minor differences, such as stylisation changes, with the band's final band name.\n\nMr. Meeble: \nMr. Meeble is an electronic rock band from Phoenix, Arizona formed in late 2005 by Devin Fleenor and Michael Plaster. The band has grown its fan base primarily via websites such as YouTube, and continues to self-release music and videos on its label, Absolute Motion. They are highly regarded for their visually intense live shows, combining video projections, RGB lasers, and other custom-made visual devices to enhance the mix of electronics and live instrumentation. A writer for Wired.com described their sound as \"coded into the musical matrix somewhere between Depeche Mode and Massive Attack\". In their own biography, the band names Thom Yorke and Air as influences.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        The Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center is located in a city that had how many inhabitants in 2015?\n        \n        assistant\n         120,284.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
