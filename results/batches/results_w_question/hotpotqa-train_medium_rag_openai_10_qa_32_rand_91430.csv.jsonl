Webster and Company: \nIn 1884, author and journalist Samuel Clemens, popularly known as Mark Twain, founded the subscription publishing firm of Charles L. Webster and Company. The firm was named after Clemens' niece\u2019s husband Charles L. Webster whom Clemens appointed the firm's business director. The formation of the company came out of Clemens' dissatisfaction with his previous publishers including Charles H. Webb, Elisha Bliss, and James R. Osgood. Clemens wanted to earn a dual income as both author and publisher of books. The first two American publications of the firm, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1885) and the \"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant\" (1885) were highly successful. The Ulysses S. Grant memoir publication in particular financially helped Grant and his family at a time when Grant was sick having been diagnosed with throat cancer. Grant was former President of the United States and top commanding general during the Civil War and Reconstruction.\n---------------------\nThe firm was named after Clemens' niece\u2019s husband Charles L.

After Grant died, Clemens gave Grant's widowed wife, Julia, a substantial record royalty check of $200,000 dollars. According to Webster, prior to his death, Grant dictated the last part of the second volume to a stenographer working for the firm, due to writing fatigue, starting with Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Webster, who accompanied the stenographer, respected Grant's reputation and honored Grant's request to keep secret from reporters that Grant dictated part of the book.\n---------------------\nDavid Lyle Boren, a former U.S. Senator and Oklahoma Governor, has served as the university's president since 1994.\n\n1927\u201328 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team: \nThe 1927\u201328 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team represented the University of Oklahoma in college basketball during the 1927\u201328 NCAA men's basketball season.

By his restatement of Sadi Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle, he gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, \"On the Moving Force of Heat\", published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem which applied to heat.\n\nAntoine equation: \nThe Antoine equation is a class of semi-empirical correlations describing the relation between vapor pressure and temperature for pure components. The Antoine equation is derived from the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation. The equation was presented in 1888 by the French engineer (1825\u20131897).\n\nEhrenfest equations: \nEhrenfest equations (named after Paul Ehrenfest) are equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions. The Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions, as both specific entropy and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.\n\nVapour pressure of water: \nThe vapour pressure of water is the pressure at which water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed state. At higher pressures water would condense. The water vapour pressure is the partial pressure of water vapour in any gas mixture in equilibrium with solid or liquid water. As for other substances, water vapour pressure is a function of temperature and can be determined with the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation.\n\nLorentz\u2013Lorenz equation: \nThe Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation, also known as the Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation and Maxwell's formula, relates the refractive index of a substance to its polarizability. Named after Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Ludvig Lorenz.\n\nClausius\u2013Duhem inequality: \nThe Clausius\u2013Duhem inequality is a way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics that is used in continuum mechanics. This inequality is particularly useful in determining whether the constitutive relation of a material is thermodynamically allowable.\n\nClausius\u2013Mossotti relation: \nThe Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation expresses the dielectric constant (relative permittivity) \u03b5 of a material in terms of the atomic polarizibility \u03b1 of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti and Rudolf Clausius. It is equivalent to the Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation. It may be expressed as:\n\nClausius\u2013Clapeyron relation: \nThe Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation, named after Rudolf Clausius and Beno\u00eet Paul \u00c9mile Clapeyron, is a way of characterizing a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent. On a pressure\u2013temperature (P\u2013T) diagram, the line separating the two phases is known as the coexistence curve. The Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation gives the slope of the tangents to this curve.
