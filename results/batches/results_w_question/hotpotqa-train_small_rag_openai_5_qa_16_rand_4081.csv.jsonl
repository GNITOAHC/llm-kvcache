Johnson then left to form Halfcocked (then known as Half Cocked) with guitarist Tommy O'Neil, bassist/backing vocalist Jhen Kobran and lead vocalist Sarah Reitkopp, later adding guitarist Johnny Rock Heatley who guested on debut album Sell Out (Halfcocked album) and joined as a full member with second album.

It was pulled by PM5K frontman Spider One two weeks before the release date. Due to being too similar to previous work, the album was originally intended to merely be delayed and revamped. However, during this time conflicts began to arise causing longtime members Dorian 27 (Dorian Heartsong) and Al3 (Allen Pahanish) to leave the band. As a result, the album was scrapped due to Spider's unwillingness to release an album of half new members and half old. The album was available for a while on Powerman 5000's official website through Spider One's record label, Megatronic Records. The promotional copies featured artwork that was different from the copies available on the website. The album however was taken down due to legal reasons. The album is now available in full on Spotify.
