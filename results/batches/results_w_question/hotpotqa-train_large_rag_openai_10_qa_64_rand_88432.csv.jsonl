The laboratory could accommodate about 40 students. The third story contained a lecture room, a private study, the library and a recitation room. The library of chemical books was established by a donation of several sets of journals and a gift of three hundred dollars from John F. Winslow.\n\nField experiment: \nA field experiment applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. Field experiments, like lab experiments, generally randomize subjects (or other sampling units) into treatment and control groups and compare outcomes between these groups. Field experiments are so named in order to draw a contrast with laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher external validity than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.\n\nAlbert Attalla: \nAlbert Attalla was a pioneer of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). He worked as a scientist for Monsanto Research Corporation, Mound Laboratories, in Miamisburg, Ohio, writing many articles about his research, including \"Lithium isotopic analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.\"\n\nNaval Medical Research Unit One: \nNaval Medical Research Unit One was a research laboratory of the US Navy which was founded as Naval Laboratory Research Unit 1, a Naval Reserve Unit at the University of California Berkeley in the life sciences building in 1934 after a campaign by a Berkeley scientist Albert P. Krueger to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to have a laboratory to study and prevent influenza and respiratory infections in naval forces. It was mobilized as an active duty naval unit in 1941 to study the epidemiological impact of diseases such as influenza, meningitis, and catarrhal fever, as well as tropical diseases such as malaria on the US Navy during World War II.\n---------------------\nWho Is Jake Ellis?: \nWho Is Jake Ellis? is an American espionage comic book published in 2011. Written by Nathan Edmondson with art by Tonci Zonjic, it is published by Image Comics. The story follows Jon Moore, a former analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. Several years before, Moore had escaped from an illegal laboratory where he had been subject to various experiments related to remote viewing. The experiments resulted in Moore seeing Jake Ellis, a ghostly figure with extensive knowledge of espionage tradecraft. With Jake providing tactical advice, Moore has become a successful criminal in Western Europe, all the time trying to avoid the Americans who he believes were responsible for his imprisonment. When a job in Barcelona goes wrong, Moore comes under renewed scrutiny from law enforcement, the Americans, and the people who imprisoned him. At Jake's suggestion, Moore locates the facility which he was held at in Marrakech, Morocco. Jake believes that the facility will help him uncover his own origins. Moore infiltrates the facility and discovers files on both him and Jake, who he now realizes was a separate person all along. As they penetrate deeper into the complex, Jake becomes more confused and eventually disappears. Moore soon finds Jake's body, hooked up to life support machines. A doctor informs him that he and Jake were their most successful subjects and that they have been observing Moore since his escape. Moore manages to escape the facility with Jake in tow and delivers the unconscious body to the American embassy.\n\nMalajoe Batawi: \nMalajoe Batawi: Kitab deri hal Perkataan-Perkataan Malajoe, Hal Memetjah Oedjar-Oedjar Malajoe dan Hal Pernahkan Tanda-Tanda Batja dan Hoeroef-Hoeroef Besar (better known by the short title Malajoe Batawi; Perfected Spelling: Melayu Betawi; literally \"Betawi Malay\") is a grammar of the Malay language as spoken in Batavia (now Jakarta) written by Lie Kim Hok.

\n Ground truth: Miami Indian burial mound.\n Prediction: coaching positions at North Texas State, Ole Miss, Vanderbilt, Livingston, Kentucky, Austin Peay, Mississippi Delta Community College and several high schools throughout Alabama. He recently served as the head coach of Etowah High School in Attalla, Alabama from 2009-2012. He was recently named the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Oxford (MS) High School.\n\nWinslow Chemical Laboratory: \nThe Winslow Chemical Laboratory was a laboratory of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus in Troy, New York, United States, which finished construction in 1866. It is named in honor of the 5th President of RPI, John F. Winslow, who donated half of the construction cost. The building is brick with stone trimmings and was originally constructed with butternut, chestnut and black walnut. The whole building was fitted for complete courses in general and analytical chemistry. The design and construction was overseen by Professor Henry B. Nason, head of the department of chemistry at the Institute. The lower story contained the metallurgical laboratory and second story contained the chemical laboratory, store rooms and work rooms. The laboratory could accommodate about 40 students. The third story contained a lecture room, a private study, the library and a recitation room. The library of chemical books was established by a donation of several sets of journals and a gift of three hundred dollars from John F. Winslow.\n\nField experiment: \nA field experiment applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. Field experiments, like lab experiments, generally randomize subjects (or other sampling units) into treatment and control groups and compare outcomes between these groups. Field experiments are so named in order to draw a contrast with laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher external validity than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.\n\nAlbert Attalla: \nAlbert Attalla was a pioneer of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).
