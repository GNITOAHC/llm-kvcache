First published in book form in 1975, Daily Racing Form began incorporating Beyer Speed Figures in a horse's past performances in 1992 and the system now assigns a Beyer number for each horse race. Overall, the number reflects not only the winning time, but the time of the race and the inherent speed of the track over which it was run. On the Beyer scale, the top stakes horses in the United States and Canada earn numbers in the 100s, while extremely strong performances can rate as high as the 120s. In Europe, Timeform has a similar rating scale that yields a number, but with a different value. The popular rule of thumb for a rough equivalent of the Timeform score is to deduct 12-14 points to achieve the Beyer figure. For American Quarter Horse racing, the Speed index rating system is used.\n\nAll American Futurity: \nThe All American Futurity is a race for two-year-old American Quarter Horse racehorses run at Ruidoso Downs Race Track in Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico on Labor Day. It is the last leg of the AQHA Triple Crown that has only been won once, by Special Effort in 1981. A $4 million bonus was once offered to the horse that could sweep all three Triple Crown races. It started in 1959, with a purse of $129,686.85. It has always billed itself as the richest race in American Quarter Horse racing, In 1978, the purse was over a million dollars and in 1982, the winner's portion of the purse totaled over a million dollars for the first time. The 2015 version of the race will have a purse of $3,000,000 with the winners share being $1,500,000, making it one of the richest races in North America.\n\nDocs Keepin Time: \nDocs Keepin Time (1987 - March 15, 2013) was a black American Quarter Horse who portrayed Black Beauty in the 1994 film adaptation of Anna Sewell's novel.

After retiring from racing in 1955, she went on to become a broodmare and had 14\u00a0foals, including 11 who earned their Race Register of Merit with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA). Her offspring earned more than $200,000 in race money. She died in 1977 and was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nTwo Eyed Jack: \nTwo Eyed Jack was a Quarter Horse stallion and showhorse, and the leading all time sire of American Quarter Horse Association (or AQHA) Champions.\n\nEasy Jet: \nEasy Jet (1967\u20131992) was an American Quarter Horse foaled, or born, in 1967, and was one of only two horses to have been a member of the American Quarter Horse Association (or AQHA) Hall of Fame as well as being an offspring of members. Easy Jet won the 1969 All American Futurity, the highest race for Quarter Horse racehorses, and was named World Champion Quarter Race Horse in the same year. He earned the highest speed rating awarded at the time\u2014AAAT. After winning 27 of his 38\u00a0races in two years of racing, he retired from the race track and became a breeding stallion.\n\nDocs Okie Quixote: \nDocs Okie Quixote (1980\u20141985), AQHA #1613457, was a sorrel Quarter Horse stallion.

It was designed by British game company Glitchers in 2016 in association with Alzheimer's Research UK, University College London and the University of East Anglia and with funding from Deutsche Telekom. The idea for the game came from neuroscientist Michael Hornberger of the University of East Anglia who collaborated with Hugo Spiers of University College London and a group of six other neuroscientists.\n\nHelen Sutermeister: \nHelen Sutermeister (1943 or 1944 - 1979) was a historian and archaeologist involved in the program of Industrial Archaeology in Ontario.

He was the son of Tytila of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty (named after his grandfather, Wuffa), who were the first kings of the East Angles. Details about R\u00e6dwald's reign are scarce, primarily because the Viking invasions of the 9th century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept. R\u00e6dwald reigned from about 599 until his death around 624, initially under the overlordship of \u00c6thelberht of Kent. In 616, as a result of fighting the Battle of the River Idle and defeating \u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria, he was able to install Edwin, who was acquiescent to his authority, as the new king of Northumbria. During the battle, both \u00c6thelfrith and R\u00e6dwald's son R\u00e6genhere were killed.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        Which team won the European Cup Final in which Helmut Winklhofer played?\n        \n        assistant\n         Bayern Munich\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
