Using an externally applied force for the initial acceleration reduces the propellant the launch vehicle needs to carry to reach orbit. This allows the launch vehicle to carry a larger payload and reduces the cost of getting to orbit. When the amount of velocity added to the launch vehicle by the ground accelerator becomes great enough, single-stage-to-orbit flight with a reusable launch vehicle becomes possible.\n\nOilgear: \nOilgear Company is an American manufacturer of fluid power and hydraulic equipment, including pumps, valves, motors, meters and other components, as well as integrated systems, headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan.
