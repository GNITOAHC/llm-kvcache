In terms of statistical significance and success rate, the study outperformed similar studies of other psychological interventions for chronic back pain.\n\nMicrocredit: \nMicrocredit is the extension of very small loans (microloans) to impoverished borrowers who typically lack collateral, steady employment and a verifiable credit history. It is designed to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. Many recipients are illiterate, and therefore unable to complete paperwork required to get conventional loans. As of 2009 an estimated 74 million people held microloans that totaled US$38 billion. Grameen Bank reports that repayment success rates are between 95 and 98 percent.\n\nMarketing assistance loans: \nMarketing assistance loans are nonrecourse loans made available to producers of loan commodities (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley oats, upland and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton, rice, soybeans, other oilseeds, honey, wool, mohair, dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas) under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec.\n---------------------\nList of current mixed martial arts champions: \nMixed martial arts (MMA) is a form of competitive combat sport, akin to boxing, muay thai, or kick boxing. MMA titles, or championship belts, are given to those fighters deemed by a promotional organization to have met a certain standard of athletic accomplishment in a specific weight class (most often by means of a championship fight). Championship belts are fought for at each weight class under a promotion, with only one belt awarded per class. Each belt is usually contested every time the belt holder fights, and passed to the victor of that fight (see the List of UFC champions for a chronology of UFC title belts). A belt may be vacated when a fighter leaves a promotion, or is suspended. At such times an interim champion may be crowned, or the belt may be awarded to the winner of a fight between top contenders.\n\nList of current Bellator fighters: \nThe Bellator MMA (formerly known as \"Bellator Fighting Championships\") promotion was started in 2008 by Bjorn Rebney and Brad Epstein as a tournament based alternative to other MMA organizations such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Strikeforce. Prior to 2015, when president Scott Coker made the decision to drop the 8-man tournament format, Bellator fighters participated in a series of tournament bouts in a set weight class over a season (usually between 10 and 13 events over 3 or 4 months). The winners of these tournaments were crowned Bellator champions, with the winners of successive tournaments in the same weight class earning the spot of no. 1 contender.\n\nWeight class (boxing): \nA weight class is a measurement weight range for boxers. The lower limit of a weight class is equal to the upper weight limit of the class below it. The top class, with no upper limit, is called heavyweight in professional boxing and super heavyweight in amateur boxing. A boxing match is usually scheduled for a fixed weight class, and each boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. Although professional boxers may fight above their weight class, an amateur boxer's weight must not fall below the lower limit. A nonstandard weight limit is called a catch weight.\n---------------------\nDifferent rates of VAT apply in different EU member states, ranging from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary. The total VAT collected by member states is used as part of the calculation to determine what each state contributes to the \"EU's budget\".\n\nPIGS (economics): \nPIGS or PIIGS or PIIGGS is an acronym used in economics and finance. The PIGS acronym originally refers, often derogatorily, to the economies of the Southern European countries of Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. During the European debt crisis, the term was also increasingly used to refer to the economies of Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain, four EU member states that were unable to refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks on their own during the crisis.\n\nEurodac: \nEuropean Dactyloscopy (EuroDac) is the European Union (EU) fingerprint database for identifying asylum seekers and irregular border-crossers. Asylum applicants and irregular border-crossers over the age of 14 have their fingerprints taken as a matter of European Community law. These are then sent in digitally to a central unit at the European Commission, and automatically checked against other prints on the database. This enables authorities to determine whether asylum seekers have already applied for asylum in another EU member state or have illegally transited through another EU member state (\"principle of first contact\"). The Automated Fingerprint Identification System is the first of its kind on the European Union level and has been operating since 15 January 2003. All EU member states currently participate in the scheme, plus three additional European countries: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.\n\nEuropean debt crisis: \nThe European debt crisis (often also referred to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n---------------------\nIts design is similar to Browning's earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the.30-06 cartridge. The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful.50 BMG cartridge, which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself (BMG standing for \"Browning Machine Gun\"). It has been referred to as \"Ma Deuce\", in reference to its M2 nomenclature. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal..50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications and low-flying aircraft. The M2 has been produced longer than any other machine gun.\n\nM45 Quadmount: \nThe M45 Quadmount (nicknamed the \"meat chopper\" and \"Krautmower\" for its high rate of fire) was a weapon mounting consisting of four of the \"HB\", or \"heavy barrel\".50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns (of the M2 Turret Type (TT) variant) mounted in pairs on each side of an open, electrically powered turret. It was developed by the W. L. Maxson Corporation to replace the earlier M33 twin mount (also from Maxson). Although designed as an anti-aircraft weapon, it was also used against ground targets. Introduced in 1943 during World War II, it remained in US service as late as the Vietnam War.\n\nMarmon-Herrington CTLS: \nThe Marmon-Herrington Combat Tank Light Series were a series of American light tanks/tankettes that were produced for the export market at the start of the Second World War. The CTL-3 had a crew of two and was armed with two.30\u00a0cal (7.62\u00a0mm) M1919 machine guns and one.50 cal (12.7\u00a0mm) M2 Browning machine gun. They were originally designed to be amphibious light tanks. They were rejected by the U.S. Marine Corps in 1939, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor they were exported and used as an emergency light tank.\n---------------------\nPound for pound: \nPound for pound is a ranking used in combat sports, such as boxing or mixed martial arts, of who the better fighters are relative to their weight (i.e., adjusted to compensate for weight class). As these fighters do not compete directly, judging the best fighter pound for pound is subjective, and ratings vary. They may be based on a range of criteria including \"quality of opposition\", factors such as how exciting the fighter is or how famous they are, or be an attempt to determine who would win if all those ranked were the same size. In boxing, the term was historically associated with fighters such as Benny Leonard and Sugar Ray Robinson who were widely considered to be the most skilled fighters of their day, to distinguish them from the generally more popular (and better compensated) heavyweight champions. Since 1990, \"The Ring\" magazine has maintained a pound for pound rank of fighters. ESPN.com has a list for mixed martial artists. In December 2013, Ronda Rousey became the first woman to appear on the top 10 of a mixed-gender major publication.\n---------------------\nIt aimed to be similar to Oriental City at 399 Edgware Road, but was much smaller and has much fewer facilities and shops.\n\nPlaza de las Estrellas: \nPlaza de las Estrellas is a shopping center located in Mexico City. It was built in 1982. It is best known as the site of the Paseo de las Luminarias, the Mexican equivalent of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Gloria Funtanet, one of the Plaza's developers, created the Paseo to honor Mexicans and Latin-Americans in showbusiness, most notably the motion picture, television, theatrical, and recording industries, of which Mexico City is the center in Latin America. Since the Paseo's dedication, which coincided with the Plaza's opening, over 1,000 entertainers, mostly from Mexico, have been inducted. The inductees are honored with a star and their handprints embedded on square tiles. The Paseo is located in the upper level of the shopping center, and doubles as the main walkway to and from the stores located on that level.\n\nOriental City: \nOriental City was a shopping centre in Colindale, London specialising in various oriental foods and items. It was located on Edgware Road, near Colindale tube station. It had a dedicated car park, and 2 floors. The complex was closed for redevelopment on 1 June 2008 and, after several changes of ownership, demolished in August 2014.\n\nAshley Landing: \nAshley Landing (originally opened as Ashley Plaza and later known as Ashley Plaza Mall), built in 1970, was the first indoor shopping mall built in the West Ashley area of Charleston, South Carolina. The center is located at 1401 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard (S.C. Highway 7) at the fork of Old Towne Road (S.C. Highway 171). It was built as a joint venture of shopping center developers the LeFrak Organization of New York City and The Cordish Company of Baltimore, Maryland under the name Ashley Plaza Mall Associates. Ashley Plaza Mall was originally constructed in the late 1960s as a strip shopping center featuring a J.M. Fields Department Stores joined to a Pantry Pride supermarket.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        Kiva is an organization that promotes development through a loan system with a repayment success rate of how much?\n        \n        assistant\n         95-98%\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
