Each week, couples are assigned missions to complete, with candid interviews of the participants to reveal their thoughts and feelings.\n---------------------\nIbn al-Shatir: \nIbn al-Shatir or Ibn ash-Shatir (Arabic: \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0637\u0631\u200e \u200e ; 1304\u20131375) was an Arab astronomer. He worked as \"muwaqqit\" (\u0645\u0648\u0642\u062a, religious timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and constructed a sundial for its minaret in 1371/72.\n\nSiege of Constantinople (717\u2013718): \nThe Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717\u2013718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople. The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil. In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III. Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself.\n\nFragmentation (sociology): \nIn urban sociology, fragmentation refers to the absence or the underdevelopment of connections between the society and the groupings of some members of that society on the lines of a common culture, nationality, race, language, occupation, religion, income level, or other common interests. This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration. bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-interscectional identity did in the 1970s [where female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression]. hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals.\n\nOccupation of al-Ubulla (870): \nThe Zanj occupation of al-Ubulla (Arabic: \u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0646\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u0644\u0629\u200e \u200e ) was an event of the Zanj Rebellion, occurring on June 28, 870. Zanj troops dispatched by their leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad advanced against the city of al-Ubulla on the Tigris and launched an attack against it. Despite a defense set up by the Abbasid government to protect the city, it was successfully stormed and taken by the rebels. Much of al-Ubulla was destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed during the assault.\n\nAl-Battani: \nAb\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn J\u0101bir ibn Sin\u0101n al-Raqq\u012b al-\u1e24arr\u0101n\u012b a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101bi\u02be al-Batt\u0101n\u012b (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a) (Latinized as Albategnius, Albategni or Albatenius) (c. 858 \u2013 929) was an Arab astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician.
