Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Webster, who accompanied the stenographer, respected Grant's reputation and honored Grant's request to keep secret from reporters that Grant dictated part of the book.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        Henry Hun was a professor of Nervous Diseases at  a medical school founded by who?\n        \n        assistant\n         Albany Medical College.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
