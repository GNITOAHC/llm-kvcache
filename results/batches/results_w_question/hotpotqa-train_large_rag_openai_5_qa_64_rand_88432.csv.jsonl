\n Ground truth: Miami Indian burial mound.\n Prediction: coaching positions at North Texas State, Ole Miss, Vanderbilt, Livingston, Kentucky, Austin Peay, Mississippi Delta Community College and several high schools throughout Alabama. He recently served as the head coach of Etowah High School in Attalla, Alabama from 2009-2012. He was recently named the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Oxford (MS) High School.\n\nWinslow Chemical Laboratory: \nThe Winslow Chemical Laboratory was a laboratory of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus in Troy, New York, United States, which finished construction in 1866. It is named in honor of the 5th President of RPI, John F. Winslow, who donated half of the construction cost. The building is brick with stone trimmings and was originally constructed with butternut, chestnut and black walnut. The whole building was fitted for complete courses in general and analytical chemistry. The design and construction was overseen by Professor Henry B. Nason, head of the department of chemistry at the Institute. The lower story contained the metallurgical laboratory and second story contained the chemical laboratory, store rooms and work rooms. The laboratory could accommodate about 40 students. The third story contained a lecture room, a private study, the library and a recitation room. The library of chemical books was established by a donation of several sets of journals and a gift of three hundred dollars from John F. Winslow.\n\nField experiment: \nA field experiment applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. Field experiments, like lab experiments, generally randomize subjects (or other sampling units) into treatment and control groups and compare outcomes between these groups. Field experiments are so named in order to draw a contrast with laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher external validity than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.\n\nAlbert Attalla: \nAlbert Attalla was a pioneer of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). He worked as a scientist for Monsanto Research Corporation, Mound Laboratories, in Miamisburg, Ohio, writing many articles about his research, including \"Lithium isotopic analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.\"\n\nNaval Medical Research Unit One: \nNaval Medical Research Unit One was a research laboratory of the US Navy which was founded as Naval Laboratory Research Unit 1, a Naval Reserve Unit at the University of California Berkeley in the life sciences building in 1934 after a campaign by a Berkeley scientist Albert P. Krueger to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to have a laboratory to study and prevent influenza and respiratory infections in naval forces. It was mobilized as an active duty naval unit in 1941 to study the epidemiological impact of diseases such as influenza, meningitis, and catarrhal fever, as well as tropical diseases such as malaria on the US Navy during World War II.\n---------------------\nMound Laboratories: \nMound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio was an Atomic Energy Commission (later Department of Energy) facility for nuclear weapon research during the Cold War, named after the nearby Miami Indian burial mound.\n\nAlbert Valley: \nAlbert Valley ( ) is a hanging valley between Conway Peak and Wendler Spur in the central Apocalypse Peaks of Victoria Land.

It was built on the summit of the Potsdam \"Telegraphenberg\" to house a solar telescope designed by the astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich. The telescope supports experiments and observations to validate (or disprove) Albert Einstein's relativity theory. The building was first conceived around 1917, built from 1919 to 1921 after a fund-raising drive, and became operational in 1924. Although Einstein never worked there, he supported the construction and operation of the telescope. It is still a working solar observatory today as part of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. Light from the telescope is directed down through the shaft to the basement where the instruments and laboratory are located. There were more than half a dozen telescopes in the laboratory.\n\nPrince Albert Radar Laboratory: \nThe Prince Albert Radar Laboratory (PARL) was a radar research facility operated by the Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE), part of the Canadian Defence Research Board. Its primary purpose was to test long-range radio propagation and radar techniques in the presence of the aurora borealis. This was part of a greater ABM effort being carried out in concert with the United States Air Force, and PARL operated along with two similar instruments at the Rome Air Development Centre and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The site continues to operate today, used as a satellite downlink station known as the Prince Albert Satellite Station (PASS).\n\nMunsell Color Company: \nThe Munsell Color Company was founded by Albert H. Munsell in 1917 with two other stockholders, Arthur Allen and Ray Greenleaf. It was located at Boston, Massachusetts. This company was manufactured to carry on business by publishing books, selling color supplies for schools such as crayons, water colors, paper colors and school supply and to teach the principles of Munsell Color System. After the death of Albert H. Munsell, his son, Alexander Ector Orr Munsell, was convinced to take over the company and reorganized it, renamed as the Munsell Color Foundation. The Munsell Color Foundation moved to New York for educational purposes and established the Munsell Laboratory Research which was funded by the Munsell family. A few years later, the Munsell Color Foundation and the Laboratory moved to Baltimore, Maryland to be close to the National Bureau of Standards and Johns Hopkins University. Alexander Munsell contributed his times attending to Johns Hopkins University and under the guidance from I.G. Priest, in order for Alexander continuing researching on his father\u2019s works. In 1983, the Foundation trustees had voted to close Munsell Color Foundation and donated to Rochester Institute of Technology which it created Munsell Color Science Laboratory.\n\nSam McCorkle: \nSam McCorkle (born November 19, 1949) is former head football coach at both the University of West Alabama and the University of Tennessee at Martin. He grew up in Meridian, Mississippi and attended Livingston University (now the University of West Alabama) where he played center from 1970 to 1972. He began his coaching career in 1973 and held assistant coaching positions at North Texas State, Ole Miss, Vanderbilt, Livingston, Kentucky, Austin Peay, Mississippi Delta Community College and several high schools throughout Alabama. He recently served as the head coach of Etowah High School in Attalla, Alabama from 2009-2012. He was recently named the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Oxford (MS) High School.\n---------------------\nBoth issues were highly controversial and hotly debated issues in West German politics at the time.\n\nNobel Prize in Literature: \nSince 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i litteratur\" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst\u00e5ende verket i en idealisk riktning\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nList of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine: \nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin\" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute. While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for \"physiology or medicine\" in his will. Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008. In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. S\u00fcdhof; they were recognised \"after discovering how cells precisely transport material\". The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.\n\nJames Franck: \nJames Franck (26 August 1882 \u2013 21 May 1964) was a German physicist who won the 1925 Nobel Prize for Physics with Gustav Hertz \"for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom\". He completed his doctorate in 1906 and his habilitation in 1911 at the Frederick William University in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of professor extraordinarius. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I.

Born Peter Halajian in Armenia, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1890 and worked in a rubber factory, opening a candy shop on February 1, 1895 in Naugatuck, Connecticut, and changing his surname to the English equivalent Paul. After selling chocolate bars to the U.S Army for use by soldiers in World War I, who demanded them when they came home, he teamed with five other Armenian investors (including his brother-in-law Cal Kazanjian, Cal's cousin Artin Kazanjian, chemist George Shamlian, Jacob Chouljian and his cousin Jacob Hagopian) to form the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company on Webster Street in New Haven in 1919 with $6,000. The company at first sold various brands of candies, including the Mounds bar, but following sugar and coconut shortages in World War II, they dropped most brands and concentrated on the Mounds bar, with the U.S. military purchasing as much as 80% of their output by 1944, packing 5 million candy bars monthly into combat rations. The Almond Joy bar was introduced in 1946. In 1978 Peter Paul merged with Cadbury-Schweppes.\n\nJanet Shamlian: \nJanet Shamlian (born May 14, 1962) is a correspondent for \"NBC News\" and reports for \"The Today Show\", \"NBC Nightly News\" and MSNBC.\n\nDespoina: \nIn Greek mythology, Despoina, Despoena or Despoine, was the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon and sister of Arion.

A strong objector to National Socialism, he was instrumental in re-establishing and organizing German science after World War II.\n\nGerman Army: \nThe German Army (German: \"Deutsches Heer\" ) is the land component of the armed forces of Germany. The present-day German Army was founded in 1955 as part of the newly formed West German \"Bundeswehr\" together with the Marine (German Navy) and the Luftwaffe (German Air Force)., the German Army had a strength of 60,431 soldiers.\n\nG\u00f6ttingen Manifesto: \nThe G\u00f6ttingen Manifesto was a declaration of 18 leading nuclear scientists of West Germany (among them the Nobel laureates Otto Hahn, Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue) against arming the West German army with tactical nuclear weapons in the 1950s, the early part of the Cold War, as the West German government under chancellor Adenauer had suggested.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics: \nThe Nobel Prize in Physics (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i fysik\" ) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nLeopard 2: \nThe Leopard 2 is a main battle tank developed by Krauss-Maffei in the 1970s for the West German Army. The tank first entered service in 1979 and succeeded the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the German Army. Various versions have served in the armed forces of Germany and 12 other European countries, as well as several non-European nations, including Canada (Leopard 2A4m can), Chile, Indonesia, Singapore and Turkey. The Leopard 2 was used in Kosovo with the German Army and has also seen action in Afghanistan with the Danish and Canadian contributions to the International Security Assistance Force, as well as seeing action in Syria with the Turkish Armed Forces against IS and the YPJ.\n\nMemorandum of T\u00fcbingen: \nThe Memorandum of T\u00fcbingen was a memorandum dealing with West German foreign policy, written by eight prominent German Protestant academics and scientists. It was sent to the German Bundestag in 1961. The memorandum was a manifesto in protest of the planned nuclear armament of West Germany and in favour of the recognition of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line as the official border between Germany and Poland by the West German government. Both issues were highly controversial and hotly debated issues in West German politics at the time.\n\nNobel Prize in Literature: \nSince 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i litteratur\" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst\u00e5ende verket i en idealisk riktning\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.\n        ------------------------------------------------\n        Answer the question with a super short answer.\n        Question:\n        What was the laboratory, in which Albert Attalla worked, named after? \n        \n        assistant\n         Mound Laboratories.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
