Mingallon pushed the team to success which has led to their promotion from the Division d’Honneur in 1999. In 2006, the club reached the national amateur level of football with its promotion to CFA2.

They nearly were promoted to Ligue 2 during the 2015-2016 season, falling short only by a single point behind Amiens SC. They again missed out on possible promotion in the following season, finishing behind division rivals Paris FC due only to goal differential.
