It was adapted as a movie in 1914, with Corbett again playing Raffles, although the adaptation removed the Holmes character.

Refugee Act: 
The United States Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-212) is an amendment to the earlier Immigration and Nationality Act and the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, and was created to provide a permanent and systematic procedure for the admission to the United States of refugees of special humanitarian concern to the U.S., and to provide comprehensive and uniform provisions for the effective resettlement and absorption of those refugees who are admitted. The act was completed on March 3, 1980, was signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 17, 1980 and became effective on April 1, 1980. This was the first comprehensive amendment of U.S. general immigration laws designed to face up to the realities of modern refugee situations by stating a clear-cut national policy and providing a flexible mechanism to meet the rapidly shifting developments of today's world policy. The main objectives of the act were to create a new definition of refugee based on the one created at the UN Convention and Protocol on the Status of Refugees, raise the limitation from 17,400 to 50,000 refugees admitted each fiscal year, provide emergency procedures for when that number exceeds 50,000, and to establish the Office of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Most importantly, it established explicit procedures on how to deal with refugees in the U.S. by creating a uniform and effective resettlement and absorption policy.

The concerto carries the dedication ""To Christabel"" (Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway). But Tertis rejected the manuscript, and composer and violist Paul Hindemith gave the first performance. The work was greeted with enthusiasm. It brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music. In ""The Manchester Guardian"", Eric Blom wrote, ""This young composer is a born genius"" and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up.

Australian nationality law:

The status of Australian nationality or Australian citizenship was created by the ""Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948"", (in 1973 renamed the ""Australian Citizenship Act 1948"") which came into force on 26 January 1949. The 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. The ""Australian Citizenship Act 2007"" replaced the 1948 Act, commencing on 1 July 2007.

Prior to this date, New Zealanders were only British subjects and New Zealand had the same nationality legislation as the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries (see also British nationality law).

2005 San Diego Padres season: 
The 2005 San Diego Padres season was the 37th season for the San Diego Padres. The 2005 team is noted as having the weakest record among division champions, finishing 82-80, the worst ever in a non-strike year.

The closest team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, were 5 games back. Three teams in the Eastern Division finished with better records than San Diego but failed to qualify for the playoffs, such as the Phillies, who won 88 games and all swept the season series with the Padres. There had been some speculation that the Padres would be the first team in MLB history to win a division and finish below.500, but their victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 30 gave them their 81st victory, guaranteeing a split record. They would be swept by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2005 NLDS.
