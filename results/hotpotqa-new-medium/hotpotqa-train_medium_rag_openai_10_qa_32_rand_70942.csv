Each room contained closet space, toilet, medicine cabinet, dresser, study table with attached shelves, chairs, rug and cot. It was the first building on campus with electric lights, installed in the 1890s. New York City architect Charles D. Marvin designed the expansion of the building in 1903, and by 1915 it was connected to other buildings in the women's quadrangle. The building became coed in 1978, and closed the next year because of its deteriorating condition. It sat unused for several years until alumni John H. and Lucile Hanson Harris provided the funds for its renovation. It reopened in 1986. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
