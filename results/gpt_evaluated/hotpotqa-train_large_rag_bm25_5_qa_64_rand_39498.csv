Jibril Agreement: 
The Jibril Agreement was a prisoner exchange deal which took place on May 21, 1985 between the Israeli government, then headed by Shimon Peres, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (an organization often known as just 'PFLP-GC'). As part of the agreement, Israel released 1,150 security prisoners held in Israeli prisons in exchange for three Israeli prisoners (Yosef Grof, Nissim Salem, Hezi Shai) captured during the First Lebanon War. This was one of several prisoner exchange agreements carried out between Israel and groups it classified as terrorist organizations around that time. Among the prisoners released by Israel were Kozo Okamoto - one of the perpetrators of the Lod Airport Massacre in May 1972, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Ahmed Yassin, a Gazan Muslim Brotherhood leader who was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in 1983 and who later became the spiritual leader of Hamas). Another prisoner released was Ali Jiddah who had served 17 years for planting of a bomb near a Jerusalem hospital in 1968 that wounded nine Israelis.

James about his life as a Manhattan celebutante and club kid. The book specifically chronicles his friend Michael Alig's rise to fame, and Alig and his roommate's subsequent murder of fellow club kid and drug dealer Andre ""Angel"" Melendez. St. James was Alig's mentor, rival, and collaborator in the Manhattan party scene, and was familiar with many of its key figures. The memoir was later retitled ""Party Monster"", after the 2003 motion picture of that name starring Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green, Chloë Sevigny, and Marilyn Manson.

Jean-Jacques Eydelie: 
Jean-Jacques Eydelie (born 3 February 1966 in Angoulême, Charente) is a French former footballer most noted for his role in the Marseille match-fixing scandal of 1993. A midfielder, Eydelie began his career with Nantes, before joining Marseille in 1992. His first season at Marseille was a success, with the club finishing top of the league, and winning the Champions League, but shortly after the Champions League final, it was revealed that he had contacted three players at Ligue 1 club Valenciennes (Jorge Burruchaga, Christophe Robert and Jacques Glassman) on behalf of the Marseille board, in order to offer bribes. Marseille needed to beat Valenciennes to secure the championship, and had induced the Valenciennes players to ""go easy"" in order that the Marseille players would not be overly exerted before the Champions League final. It was Glassman who reported the bribe, which resulted in Marseille being stripped of the 1993 French title, banned from defending the Champions League (although the win still stood), and relegated to Ligue 2. Eydelie was banned for a year by FIFA, given a one-year suspended sentence, and served 17 days in prison. Members of the Marseille board were given longer prison sentences, and Valenciennes players Burruchaga and Robert received FIFA bans for their involvement. Upon his return to football, Eydelie had a nomadic career, he trained for a few months at Benfica, played in England, Switzerland and back in France before retiring in 2003. From 2006 to 2007 he was the manager of amateur club Limoges Foot 87.
