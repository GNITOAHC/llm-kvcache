Chicago Black Renaissance: 
The Chicago Black Renaissance (also known as the Black Chicago Renaissance) was a creative movement that blossomed out of the Chicago Black Belt on the city's South Side and spanned the 1930s and 1940s before a transformation in art and culture in the mid-1950s through the turn of the century.
---------------------
Off the Wall: 
Off the Wall is the fifth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on August 10, 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It was his nineteenth album in total since ""Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5"" (1969), as well as his first album released through Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later. It was released following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in ""The Wiz"". While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album.

Josie Aiello: 
Josie Aiello is an American singer-songwriter originally from Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from the Academy of Performing Arts High School which was then followed by DePaul University. She later relocated to Los Angeles, California, finding session work there, which led her to writing songs and singing background vocals. In 1987, she appeared on the MCA Records release of the Andrew Lloyd Webber original cast recording album ""Music & Songs from Starlight Express"", appearing on four of the album's tracks. Throughout the years, Aiello has worked on music for film, television, TV commercials, soundtracks, and as a collaborative vocalist for many recording artists. Her collaborative work as a backing vocalist spans back to the 1980s. In 2000, Quincy Jones signed her to his record label Qwest, which released her debut album, ""Unkunvenshunal Girl"". In 2006, the Lady J label released her second album, ""Where I Am"". In 2015, her current record label, Breath of Life, released the single ""Elevate"" from her third album, ""Ashes to Beauty"".

Girlfriend (Paul McCartney song): 
""Girlfriend"" is a song written by Paul McCartney. McCartney thought of the song as one that Michael Jackson might like to record, and mentioned this to Jackson at a party in Hollywood. Jackson had stated in interviews with the music press in the 1970s that he was a fan of The Beatles and the chance to record a McCartney original helped to inspire his next project. However, McCartney ended up recording it himself with his band Wings, and it was issued in 1978 on the album ""London Town"". Subsequently, it was suggested by Quincy Jones as a possible track for Jackson to record for his 1979 album ""Off the Wall"". Jones was unaware that the song had been written for Jackson in the first place. Jackson's recording omitted the middle eight heard in McCartney's version. It was issued exclusively in the UK in 1980, as the fifth and final single from the ""Off the Wall"" album. This proved to be another hit single for Jackson and one of his first recordings of a Paul McCartney song.

It's the Falling in Love: 
""It's the Falling in Love"" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson with guest vocals by R&B singer–songwriter Patti Austin. It is the ninth track from his fifth studio album, ""Off the Wall"" (1979). It was written by Carole Bayer Sager and David Foster, with production by Quincy Jones. Dionne Warwick also recorded the song for her 1980 album ""No Night So Long"". The version of the song by Dee Dee Bridgewater is included on her 1979 album ""Bad For Me"". Bee Gees protégé singer Samantha Sang also released a version of this song in 1979, which is now available only in Australia on her album ""The Ultimate Collection.""

Old John Robertson: 
""Old John Robertson"" is a song by the American rock band The Byrds, written by band members Chris Hillman and Roger McGuinn, and included on their 1968 album ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"". The song was also released as the B-side to the non-album ""Lady Friend"" single on July 13, 1967 in the United States and Europe, but in the United Kingdom the B-side was switched to ""Don't Make Waves"", another Hillman and McGuinn penned song. The version of ""Old John Robertson"" featured on the flip-side of ""Lady Friend"" is a substantially different mix from the version that would later appear on ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"".

John Robinson (drummer): 
John Frederick Robinson (born December 29, 1954 in Creston, Iowa) is an American drummer and session musician. He is most known for his work with Quincy Jones, including Michael Jackson's multiplatinum ""Off the Wall"" album and the charity single ""We Are the World"".

Chicago Black Renaissance: 
The Chicago Black Renaissance (also known as the Black Chicago Renaissance) was a creative movement that blossomed out of the Chicago Black Belt on the city's South Side and spanned the 1930s and 1940s before a transformation in art and culture in the mid-1950s through the turn of the century. The movement included such famous African-American writers as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Arna Bontemps, and Lorraine Hansberry, as well as musicians Thomas A. Dorsey, Louis Armstrong, and Earl Hines. During the Great Migration, which brought tens of thousands of African-Americans to Chicago's South Side, African-American writers, artists, and community leaders began promoting racial pride and a new black consciousness, similar to that of the Harlem Renaissance in New York City. Unlike the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance did not receive the same amount of publicity on a national setting. This was due to several factors, including the lower profile participants in the movement, the lack of wealthy patrons investing in the movement, and a geographical distance from New York as a publishing center.

Louis Trudel: 
Louis Napoleon Trudel (July 21, 1912 in Salem, Massachusetts and raised in Edmonton, Alberta – March 19, 1971) was a professional ice hockey player who played 305 games in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Black Hawks. Trudel won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 and 1938.

Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey): 
Charles Robert ""Chuck"" Gardiner (December 31, 1904 – June 13, 1934) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Gardiner moved with his family to Canada as a child. Playing all of his junior hockey in or around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Gardiner joined the Chicago Black Hawks in the 1927–28 season. He played seven seasons with Chicago, winning two Vezina Trophies, earning three berths to the First All-Star team, and a berth to the Second All-Star team. In 1934, Gardiner became the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup win. A few months after winning the Cup, Gardiner died from a brain hemorrhage brought on by a tonsillar infection, at the age of 29. He became posthumously a charter member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945.
