Kingsbury was the first baseball player to earn back-to-back Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Awards, in 2001 and 2002. He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college.

Emeel Salem: 
Emeel Badie Salem, Jr. (born February 11, 1985 in Birmingham, Alabama) is an American professional baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He bats and throws left-handed, and primarily plays center field.

Salem was drafted as a junior at The University of Alabama in the 10th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft by the Baltimore Orioles, but opted to return for his senior year. Following his final season, he was drafted in the 6th round by the Tampa Bay Rays, signing a professional contract in June 2007.

Jackie Walker (American football, born 1962): 
Jackie Walker (born November 3, 1962) is a former an American football linebacker who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL Draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana. He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987. Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp. He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers, Miami Hooters, and Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League.

1994 Winter Olympics: 
The 1994 Winter Olympics (Norwegian: ""Olympiske vinterleker 1994"" ), officially known as the XVII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les ""XVIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver""), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 12 to 27 February 1994 in and around Lillehammer, Norway. Lillehammer failed to win the bid for the 1992 event, losing to Albertville respectively. Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, after beating Anchorage, United States; Östersund, Sweden; and Sofia, Bulgaria. Lillehammer is the northernmost city to ever host the Winter Games. The Games were the first to be held in a different year from the Summer Olympics, the first and only one to be held two years after the previous winter games, and the most recent to be held in a small town. The Games were the second Winter Olympics hosted in Norway, after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, and the fourth Olympics in the Nordic countries, after the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.

Australia at the 1952 Winter Olympics: 
Australia's second Winter Olympic Games appearance was at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway. It was 16 years since Australia's last Winter Games, as the 1940 and 1944 Winter Olympics were cancelled, and Australia did not compete in the 1948 Winter Olympics. Australia sent nine athletes and competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating and speed skating. Nancy Hallam and Gweneth Molony were Australia's first women athletes at the Winter Olympics.

Biathlon at the Winter Olympics: 
Biathlon debuted at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley with the men's 20 km individual event. At the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, the men's 4×7.5 km relay debuted, followed by the 10 km sprint event at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Beginning at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, women's biathlon debuted with the 15 km individual, 3×7.5 km relay (4×7.5 km during 1994-2002, and 4×6 km in 2006), and 7.5 km sprint. A pursuit race (12.5 km for men and 10 km for women) was included at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The top 60 finishers of the sprint race (10 km for men and 7.5 km for women) would qualify for the pursuit event. The sprint winner starts the race, followed by each successive biathlete at the same time interval he/she trailed the sprint winner in that event. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, a mass start (15 km for men and 12.5 km for women) was introduced where the top 30 biathletes from the previous four events were allowed to start together for the competition.

List of Olympic venues in ice hockey: 
For the Summer and Winter Olympics, there are 46 venues that have been or will be used for ice hockey. The 46 venues are the most for any Winter Olympic sport. The first venue ice hockey took place in was indoor during the ""Summer"" Olympics in 1920. Twelve years later, ice hockey was held both indoors and outdoors. The plan was to have two of the twelve matches for those games played indoors, but thawing ice at the outdoor venue for those games forced four of the outdoor games to be moved indoors in 1932. Despite the success of indoor ice hockey venues at the 1932 Winter Olympics, it would be twenty years before another indoor venue would be used. Ice hockey would not be indoors entirely until the 1964 Games where they have remained as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Both venues for the 2014 Winter Olympics are constructed to be indoors.
