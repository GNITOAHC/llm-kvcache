Live at the Greek Theatre 2008: 
Live at the Greek Theatre 2008 is a live album released by musician Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band in 2010. It is one of few current albums that Ringo Starr has released on a major label, this one being released on Universal Music Group, as well as his 2008 studio album ""Liverpool 8"", which was released under Capitol Records. One of the reasons that this particular live album might have been released on a more popular label is because the Greek Theatre (located in Los Angeles) is more of a bigger venue then some of Ringo's other concert locations. The album oddly removes many of the songs that were sung at the concert. On the filmed concert, also included with the CD, there are several more songs. Such examples are Edgar Winter's ""Frankenstein"" and what would have been an obvious choice for the album, a live version of Ringo Starr's ""Liverpool 8"" song. Also, there is a sing-along version of John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"". News of the album was originally revealed on the Beatles' official website as well as Ringo's official website.
