1,"to Starr during the making of ""Ringo"". The track serves as a farewell from Starr to his audience in the manner of a show-closing finale, by lyrically referring to the completion of the album. During the extended fadeout, Starr delivers a spoken message in which he thanks the musicians and studio personnel who helped with the recording of ""Ringo"" â€“ among them, Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and his producer, Richard Perry.

Lancashire Hustler:

Live at the Greek Theatre 2008: 
Live at the Greek Theatre 2008 is a live album released by musician Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band in 2010. It is one of few current albums that Ringo Starr has released on a major label, this one being released on Universal Music Group, as well as his 2008 studio album ""Liverpool 8"", which was released under Capitol Records. One of the reasons that this particular live album might have been released on a more popular label is because the Greek Theatre (located in Los Angeles) is more of a bigger venue then some of Ringo's other concert locations. The album oddly removes many of the songs that were sung at the concert. On the filmed concert, also included with the CD, there are several more songs. Such examples are Edgar Winter's ""Frankenstein"" and what would have been an obvious choice for the album, a live version of Ringo Starr's ""Liverpool 8"" song. Also, there is a sing-along version of John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"". News of the album was originally revealed on the Beatles' official website as well as Ringo's official website.
