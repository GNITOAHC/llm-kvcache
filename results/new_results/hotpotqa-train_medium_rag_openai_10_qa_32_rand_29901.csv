It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807. It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. ""The Age of Reason"" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as ""an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text"". It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator-God.

In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ""The Miracle of Theism,"" though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.

The Age of Reason: 
The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist Thomas Paine, arguing for the philosophical position of Deism. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807. It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. ""The Age of Reason"" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as ""an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text"". It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator-God.

Spatial icon: 
The concept of the spatial icon, introduced by Alexei Lidov, plays a central role in hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a temple or sanctuary. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces. It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from murals to liturgical artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred relics and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image. Various dynamic and performative media also play a significant role, such as rituals and song, as well as the artistic manipulation of natural light, lighting and sounds, and also elements dealing with odor and touch. From this point of view, Medieval churches can be seen as spatial icons in which divine image-visions, such as Paradise or Heavenly Jerusalem, were incarnated in the sacred space by means of the various media employed without being directly depicted. The temples and sanctuaries of various religions were originally conceived, designed and created as spatial icons. In the Christian tradition in particular, impressive examples of spatial icons are to be found in re-creations of the Holy Land, or ""New Jerusalems"". In many cases, spatial icons were the work of specific authors; their art could be compared with that of contemporary film directors, for in both cases, there is the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.

Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose: 
The sentence ""Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."" was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem ""Sacred Emily"", which appeared in the 1922 book ""Geography and Plays"". In that poem, the first ""Rose"" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning ""things are what they are"", a statement of the law of identity, ""A is A"". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the ""rose"" as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, ""Now listen! I’m no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a... is a... is a...' Yes, I’m no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years."" (""Four in America"").

Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, and Henri Matisse, would meet.

The family became the heads of a consortium of the prominent Guelfs that securely controlled Florence after the battle of Benevento in 1266. In Florence, the Cerchi purchased some of the ancient structures in the closely packed inner city formerly belonging to the counts Guidi, cheek-by-jowl with the proud Florentine family of the Donati, with whom their growing mutual antagonism was expressed in violent episodes that polarized Florence within a couple of decades in a virtual civil war that aligned behind two captains, Corso Donati of the ""Neri"" Guelf faction— the ""Black"" Guelfs of the old noble oligarchy— and Vieri de' Cerchi of the ""Bianchi"", the moderate party that represented itself as champions of working people (the ""magri"").

Mutual knowledge (logic): 
Mutual knowledge is a fundamental concept about information in game theory, (epistemic) logic, and epistemology. An event is mutual knowledge if all agents know that the event occurred. However, mutual knowledge by itself implies nothing about what agents know about other agents' knowledge: i.e. it is possible that an event is mutual knowledge but that each agent is unaware that the other agents know it has occurred. Common knowledge is a related but stronger notion; any event that is common knowledge is also mutual knowledge.

Copeland House (Ehrhardt, South Carolina): 
The Copeland House is important as an example of a vernacular farm residence built in the Carolina back country after 1790, along what would in the early 19th century become an established coach road from the coastal counties to the interior. Constructed in the late 18th century by John Jacob Copeland (1775-1853), it became the center for his family that grew to include eight children. The house and the nearby farms, many belonging to families related by marriage over time, became significant contributors to a German Lutheran settlement in the area which took shape in this part of South Carolina a generation before the start of the American Revolution. The nearest town, Ehrhardt, South Carolina, is about 2 miles east of the Copeland House. The residence, initially built in the early 1790s, is significant for its association with the Copeland family, who built the house, occupied it continuously and farmed the surrounding property for nearly 200 years. In the mid-1980s the Copeland descendants, heirs to the fifth generation of the family, sold the property. The original square log and dovetail construction remains largely intact, even after several significant 19th and early 20th century modifications and additions were made. Subsequent owners have generally maintained the original fabric while stabilizing the structure. The house, together with several related dependencies and an adjacent Copeland family burial site, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1991.
