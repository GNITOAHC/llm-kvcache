It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807. It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. ""The Age of Reason"" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as ""an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text"". It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator-God.

In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ""The Miracle of Theism,"" though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.
