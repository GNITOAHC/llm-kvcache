After his death, the Stanley of Alderley and Eddisbury baronies remained united; most holders have since chosen to be known as ""Lord Stanley of Alderley"". The 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley had a career in the Diplomatic Service; as he was childless he was succeeded by his younger brother, the 4th Baron. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Oldham. In 1909, the 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley acquired a further title when he succeeded his first cousin once removed, the Earl of Sheffield, according to a special remainder and thus inherited the title of 4th Baron Sheffield. After his death the titles passed to his son, the 5th Baron Stanley of Alderley. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Eddisbury and also served as Governor of Victoria. His eldest son, the 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, sold the family seat of Alderley Hall in 1938. He was married four times, the second time to Sylvia Ashley. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, who preferred to be known as Lord Sheffield. He only held the titles for three months. s of 2013 the titles are held by the latter's cousin, the 9th Baron Stanley of Alderley, who succeeded his father in that year. He is the grandson of the Hon. Oliver Hugh Stanley, youngest son of the 4th Baron.

Ninlil: 
In Sumerian religion, Ninlil (𒀭𒊩𒌆𒆤 <a href=""ERE%C5%A0"">NIN</a>.LÍL""lady of the open field"" or ""Lady of the Wind""), also called Sud, in Assyrian called ""Mulliltu"", is the consort goddess of Enlil. Her parentage is variously described. Most commonly she is called the daughter of Haia (god of stores) and Nunbarsegunu (or Ninshebargunnu [a goddess of barley] or Nisaba). Another Akkadian source says she is the daughter of Anu (a.k.a. An) and Antu (Sumerian Ki). Other sources call her a daughter of Anu and Nammu.

Sadie Martinot: 
She was born Sarah Frances Marie Martinot in New York City on December 19, 1861, the daughter of William Alexander and Mary Lydia (née Randall) Martinot. Her father was the son of John P. Martinot, a French immigrant who founded a successful wholesale firm dealing in imported silk products. William Martinot worked for his father's firm and had served in the American Civil War and later as a New York City police detective who once brought charges of corruption against a NYPD police captain. Her mother was said to be of the family that once owned Randall's Island in Manhattan. Before taking to the stage at 15, Martinot was educated at area public schools and the Ursuline Convent in New Rochelle, New York. Some accounts have her birth name as Sally Martin or Sally Eagan, the daughter of an Irish-American single mother who worked hard to ensure her a good education. In March 1894 Martinot stated to the press that, though she would have been proud to have been raised under such a circumstance, she in fact was the daughter of Mary and William Alexander Martinot.

Emilie Schenkl: 
Emilie Schenkl (26 December 1910 – March 1996) was the wife, or companion, of Subhas Chandra Bose—a major leader of Indian nationalism—and the mother of his daughter, Anita Bose Pfaff (born 29 November 1942). Schenkl, an Austrian, and her baby daughter were left without support in wartime Europe by Bose, following his departure for Southeast Asia in February 1943 and death in 1945. In 1948, both were met by Bose's brother Sarat Chandra Bose and his family in Vienna in an emotional meeting. In the post-war years, Schenkl worked shifts in the trunk exchange and was the main breadwinner of her family, which included her daughter and her mother.
