Nap Rucker of the Brooklyn Dodgers came up to the majors in 1907, initially throwing hard stuff but later switching to the knuckleball. A 1908 article credited Lew Moren as the inventor of the pitch. Ed Cicotte earned a full-time spot with the Detroit Tigers in 1908, earning the nickname ""Knuckles"" for his signature pitch. A picture of Ed Summers showed him gripping what he called a ""dry spitter"" using a variation of the knuckleball grip using the knuckles of his index and middle fingers.
