United States presidential election, 1964: 
The United States presidential election of 1964 was the 45th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964. Democratic candidate and incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had come to office less than a year earlier following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy. Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy’s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe’s re-election in 1820. It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes. No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson’s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin.

Daou also said the website had no financial ties to Clinton.

USS Barber (DE-161): 
USS ""Barber"" (DE-161/APD-57), a ""Buckley""-class destroyer escort of the United States Navy, was named in honor of brother Malcolm, Randolph, and Leroy Barber who were all killed aboard the USS ""Oklahoma"" on 7 December 1941. The ship was laid down in April 1943 and launched one month later, but because the Barber brothers' mother was not available on the day of launching, the ship was christened at the same time that she was commissioned in October 1943. After a year of service in the Atlantic escorting convoys and helping to sink ""U-488"", ""Barber"" was converted to a ""Charles Lawrence""-class high speed transport and assigned the new hull code of ""APD-57"". After her conversion was complete in January 1945, ""Barber"" sailed for duty in the Pacific. After earning three battle stars for her wartime service, ""Barber"" was decommissioned in March 1946 and placed in reserve.

Field experiment: 
A field experiment applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. Field experiments, like lab experiments, generally randomize subjects (or other sampling units) into treatment and control groups and compare outcomes between these groups. Field experiments are so named in order to draw a contrast with laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher external validity than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.

Who Is Jake Ellis?: 
Who Is Jake Ellis? is an American espionage comic book published in 2011. Written by Nathan Edmondson with art by Tonci Zonjic, it is published by Image Comics. The story follows Jon Moore, a former analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. Several years before, Moore had escaped from an illegal laboratory where he had been subject to various experiments related to remote viewing. The experiments resulted in Moore seeing Jake Ellis, a ghostly figure with extensive knowledge of espionage tradecraft. With Jake providing tactical advice, Moore has become a successful criminal in Western Europe, all the time trying to avoid the Americans who he believes were responsible for his imprisonment. When a job in Barcelona goes wrong, Moore comes under renewed scrutiny from law enforcement, the Americans, and the people who imprisoned him. At Jake's suggestion, Moore locates the facility which he was held at in Marrakech, Morocco. Jake believes that the facility will help him uncover his own origins. Moore infiltrates the facility and discovers files on both him and Jake, who he now realizes was a separate person all along. As they penetrate deeper into the complex, Jake becomes more confused and eventually disappears. Moore soon finds Jake's body, hooked up to life support machines. A doctor informs him that he and Jake were their most successful subjects and that they have been observing Moore since his escape. Moore manages to escape the facility with Jake in tow and delivers the unconscious body to the American embassy.
