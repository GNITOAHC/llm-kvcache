These normal faults express themselves on a regional scale; upper crust fractures into tilted fault blocks, and ductile lower crust ascends. This results in uplift, cooling, and exhumation of ductily deformed deeper crust. The large unit of tilted blocks and associated crust can help form an integral part of metamorphic core complexes and can occur on both continental and oceanic crust.

Rhubarb pie: 
Rhubarb pie is a pie with a rhubarb filling. Popular in the UK, where rhubarb has been cultivated since the 1600s, its introduction to Europe from China is attributed to Marco Polo. Besides diced rhubarb, it almost always contains a large amount of sugar to balance the intense tartness of the plant. A strawberry rhubarb pie, is a type of tart and sweet pie made with a strawberry and rhubarb filling. Sometimes tapioca is also used. The pie is usually prepared with a bottom pie crust and a variety of styles of upper crust. In the United States, often a lattice-style upper crust is used. This pie is a traditional dessert in the northeastern United States but is little known outside of that region in the US. It is part of New England cuisine. Rhubarb pies and desserts are popular in Canada too since the rhubarb plant can survive in cold weather climates.

Upper Crust Pizzeria:

The square shaped pizza is the result of being baked in a square pan, which is often not a pizza pan. Rather, industrial parts trays are often used, which were originally made to hold small parts in factories.

His birthplace was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 in recognition of Rumford's scientific accomplishments, which notably include the development of the Rumford stove, a fireplace design that was significantly more efficient at retaining heat in the house than older and larger fireplaces.

List of knuckleball pitchers: 
Knuckleball pitchers are baseball players who rely on the knuckleball as their primary pitch, or pitch primarily based on their ability to throw a knuckleball. The inventor of the knuckleball has never been established, although several pitchers from the early 20th century have been credited. Baseball statistician and historian Rob Neyer named four individuals in an article he wrote in the 2004 book ""The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers"" as potentially deserving credit, any of whom may have originated the pitch in either the 1907 or 1908 seasons. Nap Rucker of the Brooklyn Dodgers came up to the majors in 1907, initially throwing hard stuff but later switching to the knuckleball. A 1908 article credited Lew Moren as the inventor of the pitch. Ed Cicotte earned a full-time spot with the Detroit Tigers in 1908, earning the nickname ""Knuckles"" for his signature pitch. A picture of Ed Summers showed him gripping what he called a ""dry spitter"" using a variation of the knuckleball grip using the knuckles of his index and middle fingers.

Poliziano: 
Angelo Ambrogini (14 July 1454 – 24 September 1494), commonly known by his nickname Poliziano (] ; anglicized as Politian; Latin: "" Politianus""), was an Italian classical scholar and poet of the Florentine Renaissance. His scholarship was instrumental in the divergence of Renaissance (or Humanist) Latin from medieval norms and for developments in philology. His nickname, ""Poliziano"", by which he is chiefly identified to the present day, was derived from the Latin name of his birthplace, Montepulciano (""Mons Politianus"").

The original name was chosen because a d/b/a had already been formed under the name Houston City Magazine by David Crossley and Tom Curtis (although they had not actually published a magazine by this title). A 51% interest in the magazine was purchased by ""Texas Parade"" in 1978, and upon the hiring of Crossley and Curtis it was subsequently re-titled ""Houston City Magazine.""

Basin and range topography: 
Basin and range topography is an alternating landscape of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. It is a result of crustal extension/stretching (extensional tectonics) of the lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) due to mantle upwelling, gravitational collapse, crustal thickening, or relaxation of confining stresses. Crustal extension causes the thinning and deformation of the upper crust in an orientation perpendicular to the direction of extension. As the plates pull apart, they thin allowing the hot mantle to rise close to the surface. When the crust is extended it fractures along a fault plane, creating a series of long parallel normal faults. Between these normal faults are blocks, which subside, get uplifted or tilted. This is known as block faulting. Basins are formed due to subsidence of a block, while the blocks adjacent to the subsidence gets uplifted creating ranges. Normal faults are on both sides the blocks; creating alternating elevated or subsided blocks, otherwise known as horst and graben. Basins and ranges can also be formed by blocks that are tilted causing one side to subside while the other side gets uplifted. These only have one side with a normal fault, this is known as tilted block faulting. Extension causes the plate to stretch, fracture and thin. Mountains rise and valleys drop, over a long period of time creating what we see as basin and range topography.

California-style pizza: 
California-style pizza (also known as California pizza or Gourmet pizza) is a style of single-serving pizza that combines New York and Italian thin crust with toppings from the California cuisine cooking style. Its invention is generally attributed to chef Ed LaDou, and Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. Wolfgang Puck, after meeting LaDou, popularized the style of pizza in the rest of the country. It is served in a number of California Cuisine restaurants.
