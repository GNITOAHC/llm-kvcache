Siege of Constantinople (717–718): 
The Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717–718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople. The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil. In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III. Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself.

Fragmentation (sociology): 
In urban sociology, fragmentation refers to the absence or the underdevelopment of connections between the society and the groupings of some members of that society on the lines of a common culture, nationality, race, language, occupation, religion, income level, or other common interests. This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration. bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-interscectional identity did in the 1970s [where female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression]. hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals.

Occupation of al-Ubulla (870): 
The Zanj occupation of al-Ubulla (Arabic: دخول الزنج الأبلة‎ ‎ ) was an event of the Zanj Rebellion, occurring on June 28, 870.

Much of al-Ubulla was destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed during the assault.

Al-Battani: 
Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Jābir ibn Sinān al-Raqqī al-Ḥarrānī aṣ-Ṣābiʾ al-Battānī (Arabic: محمد بن جابر بن سنان البتاني) (Latinized as Albategnius, Albategni or Albatenius) (c. 858 – 929) was an Arab astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician.
