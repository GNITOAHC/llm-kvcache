Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Webster, who accompanied the stenographer, respected Grant's reputation and honored Grant's request to keep secret from reporters that Grant dictated part of the book.

The Antoine equation is a class of semi-empirical correlations describing the relation between vapor pressure and temperature for pure components. The Antoine equation is derived from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. The equation was presented in 1888 by the French engineer (1825–1897).

Ehrenfest equations: 
Ehrenfest equations (named after Paul Ehrenfest) are equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions. The Clausius–Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions, as both specific entropy and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.

Vapour pressure of water: 
The vapour pressure of water is the pressure at which water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed state. At higher pressures water would condense. The water vapour pressure is the partial pressure of water vapour in any gas mixture in equilibrium with solid or liquid water. As for other substances, water vapour pressure is a function of temperature and can be determined with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.

Lorentz–Lorenz equation: 
The Lorentz–Lorenz equation, also known as the Clausius–Mossotti relation and Maxwell's formula, relates the refractive index of a substance to its polarizability. Named after Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Ludvig Lorenz.

Clausius–Duhem inequality: 
The Clausius–Duhem inequality is a way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics that is used in continuum mechanics. This inequality is particularly useful in determining whether the constitutive relation of a material is thermodynamically allowable.

Clausius–Mossotti relation: 
The Clausius–Mossotti relation expresses the dielectric constant (relative permittivity) ε of a material in terms of the atomic polarizibility α of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti and Rudolf Clausius. It is equivalent to the Lorentz–Lorenz equation. It may be expressed as:

Clausius–Clapeyron relation: 
The Clausius–Clapeyron relation, named after Rudolf Clausius and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron, is a way of characterizing a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent. On a pressure–temperature (P–T) diagram, the line separating the two phases is known as the coexistence curve. The Clausius–Clapeyron relation gives the slope of the tangents to this curve. Mathematically,

Zakariya Rashid Hassan al-Ashiri: 
Zakariya Rashid Hassan Al-Ashiri (Arabic: زكريا راشد حسن العشيري‎ ‎ ), also spelled Al Asheri and Aushayri, (1971– April 9, 2011), was a forty-year-old Bahraini blogger and journalist, worked as an editor and writer for a local blog news website in Al Dair, Bahrain. He was killed on April 9, 2011 while in custody of the Bahraini Government. Al-Ashiri was the first journalist in Bahrain to die in direct relation to his work since The Committee to Protect Journalists started keeping records in 1992, and he was the first to die in the Bahraini uprising (2011–present).

Hamletmachine: 
Hamletmachine (in German, Die Hamletmaschine) is a postmodernist drama by German playwright and theatre director Heiner Müller. Written in 1977, the play is loosely based on ""Hamlet"" by William Shakespeare. The play originated in relation to a translation of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" that Müller undertook. Some critics claim the play problematizes the role of intellectuals during the East German Communism area; others argue that the play should be understood in relation to wider post-modern concepts.
