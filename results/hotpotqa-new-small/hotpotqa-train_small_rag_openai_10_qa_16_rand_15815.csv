1,"coach prior to this season. This year's Celtics team was severely hindered by the loss of star forward Larry Bird to a heel injury which required surgery. Bird played only six early-season games before being lost to injury. Initially, Bird was expected back in March, but it was delayed and ultimately became a season-ending injury. The results were dramatic as the Celtics, who had averaged over 60 wins per season thus far in the 1980s, fell to just 42 wins in this season. Coming into the season, the Celtics had been the Eastern Conference's #1 seed five years in a row. This season they were the #8 seed, clinching a playoff spot in the season's final game. This season included some bright spots, particularly the emergence of guard Reggie Lewis, who had been only a minimal bench contributor in his rookie season of 1987-88, but averaged nearly 20 points per game as a starter in 1988-89.

1946–47 Boston Celtics season: 
The 1946–47 Boston Celtics season was the first season of the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA/NBA). Walter A.

On an early June day in 1946, Brown, who operated the Boston Garden arena and was part of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins, was the driving force behind the Basketball Association of America and the Celtics birth. After considering several team names, including Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, Brown opted for Celtics. He hoped to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish American population. John Davis ""Honey"" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59–53 to the Providence Steamrollers. Although the Celtics would eventually become the signature franchise of the NBA, the club had a lacklustre first season as they started with 0 wins and 5 losses. The Celtics won their first game of the season against the Toronto Huskies.

Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.1 despite only playing 38 games due to ACL injury. The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway. The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2004–05 season. This season would mark the end of the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett era in Boston as they were traded to the Brooklyn Nets during the 2013 off-season.

This was also the final season for longtime Celtics All-Star forward Kevin McHale, as he would retire the following offseason. During the offseason, the Celtics signed free agent All-Star forward Xavier McDaniel. However, the team got off to a bad start losing eight of their first ten games, but would post a nine-game winning streak in March to finish second in the Atlantic Division with a solid 48–34 record (only 3 games behind the previous year, when Bird was on the team). The Celtics held home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs against the 5th-seeded Charlotte Hornets, but during Game 1 of the series, All-Star forward Reggie Lewis collapsed on the court (Lewis would never again play in a Celtics uniform, and would die before the next season began). Boston held on to win Game 1, but (minus Lewis) lost the next three games, and thus the series.
