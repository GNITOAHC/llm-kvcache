Cleopas Ncube: 
Cleopas Ncube (born November 21, 1983) is a Canadian wrestler. He finished in 4th place in the 70kg event at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships, losing the bronze medal final to Ali Shabanau of Belarus. He also ranked among the best in several international competitions, including the Dave Schultz International.

1976–77 Los Angeles Kings season: 
The 1976–77 season was similar to the year before for the Kings. Dionne continued to lead the offense, the defense was unspectacular but solid, but it was a season of roster turnover as some aging veterans departed (e.g. Bob Nevin, Mike Corrigan) and others lost significant time to injuries (Larry Brown, Juha Widing, Sheldon Kannegiesser). Youngsters like Glen Goldup, Lorne Stamler, and Steve Clippingdale struggled although second year defenseman Gary Sargent was solid. The Kings added Dave Schultz (the ""Hammer"") to replace Dan Maloney who left in the Dionne trade for toughness, but it took nearly all season for the roster to jell. In addition, backup goalie Gary Edwards struggled and was eventually traded for Gary Simmons; he was not the answer either, so #1 goalie Rogie Vachon was overworked. The Kings were also stuck behind the Montreal Canadiens who finished an amazing 60–8–12; many say this was the greatest team in NHL history.

Tela O'Donnell: 
Tela O'Donnell (born July 16, 1982 in Homer, Alaska) is a retired amateur American freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. She picked up the 2003 U.S. national runner-up trophy in her respective division, and later represented the United States team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, finishing sixth in the process.

Cochrane was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, but grew up in Kamloops, British Columbia.

Foxcatcher: 
Foxcatcher is a 2014 American true crime sports drama film produced and directed by Bennett Miller. Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire Du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist brothers Mark (Freestyle Wrestling - 82 kg) and Dave Schultz (Freestyle Wrestling - 74 kg) to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of Dave by John du Pont in January 1996. Although the film's action is largely set at Foxcatcher Farm, du Pont's now-broken-up 800-acre suburban Philadelphia estate, the majority of the movie was filmed in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Moses Wright Hannon: 
Moses Wright Hannon (December 14, 1827 – June 3, 1897) was a Confederate States Army colonel during the American Civil War. In August 1864, he was assigned to duty as an acting brigadier general by General John Bell Hood, subject to appointment by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and confirmation by the Confederate Senate. Although Hannon commanded a brigade in the cavalry corps of the Army of Tennessee and in Major General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps from June 1864 until the end of the war, he never was officially appointed by Jefferson Davis and confirmed by the Confederate Senate to brigadier general rank.

Confederate Monument in Glasgow: 
The Confederate Monument in Glasgow, Kentucky, built in 1905 by the Kentucky Women's Monumental Association and former Confederate soldier John A. Murray, commemorates those who gave their lives in service for the Confederate States of America. It is located on the side of Glasgow's courthouse. The Confederate soldier, made of bronze, is at parade rest, and features details such as a bedroll, canteen, kepi hat, and rifle. It stands on a limestone pedestal.

Confederate States peace commission: 
On February 15, 1861, the newly formed Congress of the Confederate States of America adopted a resolution empowering the President-elect Jefferson Davis to appoint a commission of three men to negotiate “friendly relations” with the federal government of the United States. On February 25, newly inaugurated President Davis chose Martin J. Crawford of Georgia, John Forsyth of Alabama, and Andre B. Roman of Louisiana to serve as commissioners. On February 27, President Davis wrote a letter to Abraham Lincoln, President-elect of the United States, introducing the commissioners as representatives of the government of the Confederate States. The commission was not received by Lincoln. On March 12, a letter was sent to William H. Seward, Secretary of State of the United States, introducing the commissioners and explaining their peaceful intent. The commission was not received by Seward. On March 15, the commission filed a memorandum which outlined how they had been ignored by Seward and Lincoln. The commissioners were rejected because acceptance of the commission would be recognition of the Confederate States of America.

2nd Confederate States Congress: 
The Second Confederate States Congress, consisting of the Confederate States Senate and the Confederate States House of Representatives, met from May 2, 1864, to March 18, 1865, during the last year of Jefferson Davis's presidency, at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia, Confederate States. Its members were elected in the 1863 Confederate Congressional elections.

Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi): 
The Beauvoir estate is notable as the historic post-war home (1876-1889) of the former President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis, (1807/08-1889), (who was also former U.S. Representative, (1845-1846), and more influentially as United States Senator from Mississippi, (1847-1851, 1857-1861) and in between U.S. Secretary of War, (1853-1857), under 14th President Franklin Pierce). Its construction was begun in 1848 facing the Gulf Coastline (Gulf of Mexico) at Biloxi, Mississippi. It was purchased earlier in 1873 by the planter Samuel Dorsey and his wife Sarah Dorsey. After her husband's death in 1875, the widow, Sarah Ellis Dorsey learned of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis' difficulties. She invited him to visit at the plantation and offered him a cottage near the main house, where he could live and work at his memoirs (""""Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government""""). He ended up living there the rest of his life. The house and plantation have since been designated as a National Historic Landmark, recognized and listed by the U.S. Department of the Interior and its National Park Service (established 1916).

John Holt Duncan: 
John Holt Duncan (1820–1896) was one of eight founders of Beta Theta Pi, a prominent college fraternity founded at Miami University in 1839 and was its first president.

He lost a leg as a result of a battle wound on September 20, 1862 at the First Battle of Newtonia.
