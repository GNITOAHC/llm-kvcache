1,"coach prior to this season. This year's Celtics team was severely hindered by the loss of star forward Larry Bird to a heel injury which required surgery. Bird played only six early-season games before being lost to injury. Initially, Bird was expected back in March, but it was delayed and ultimately became a season-ending injury. The results were dramatic as the Celtics, who had averaged over 60 wins per season thus far in the 1980s, fell to just 42 wins in this season. Coming into the season, the Celtics had been the Eastern Conference's #1 seed five years in a row. This season they were the #8 seed, clinching a playoff spot in the season's final game. This season included some bright spots, particularly the emergence of guard Reggie Lewis, who had been only a minimal bench contributor in his rookie season of 1987-88, but averaged nearly 20 points per game as a starter in 1988-89.

1946–47 Boston Celtics season: 
The 1946–47 Boston Celtics season was the first season of the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA/NBA). Walter A. Brown was the man who was responsible for starting the franchise. On an early June day in 1946, Brown, who operated the Boston Garden arena and was part of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins, was the driving force behind the Basketball Association of America and the Celtics birth. After considering several team names, including Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, Brown opted for Celtics. He hoped to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish American population. John Davis ""Honey"" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59–53 to the Providence Steamrollers. Although the Celtics would eventually become the signature franchise of the NBA, the club had a lacklustre first season as they started with 0 wins and 5 losses. The Celtics won their first game of the season against the Toronto Huskies.

2004–05 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2004–05 NBA season was the 59th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. The season is memorable when the team hired Doc Rivers to be their head coach for the upcoming season. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired All-Star guard Gary Payton, and former Celtics forward Rick Fox from the Los Angeles Lakers, but Fox would retire before the season. The Celtics struggled playing under.500 for the first half of the season. At midseason, Payton was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for former Celtic All-Star forward Antoine Walker. However, Payton would never suit up for the Hawks and was released shortly after. He then re-signed with the Celtics afterwards for the remainder of the season. The team went on a 7-game winning streak in March, finishing first place in the Atlantic Division with a 45–37 record. Paul Pierce was selected for the 2005 NBA All-Star Game.

2002–03 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2002–03 NBA season was the 57th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired Vin Baker from the Seattle SuperSonics. The Celtics posted a six-game winning streak after losing their first two games, and got off to a solid 16–7 start. However, they lost six straight games in March, and finished third in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record. The team made the playoffs for the second time with team captain Paul Pierce, but this time as the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference. Pierce and Antoine Walker were both selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game.

2002–03 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2002–03 NBA season was the 57th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired Vin Baker from the Seattle SuperSonics. The Celtics posted a six-game winning streak after losing their first two games, and got off to a solid 16–7 start. However, they lost six straight games in March, and finished third in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record. The team made the playoffs for the second time with team captain Paul Pierce, but this time as the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference. Pierce and Antoine Walker were both selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. After defeating the 3rd-seeded Indiana Pacers four games to two in the first round, they were unable to stop the New Jersey Nets as they were swept in four straight Conference Semifinal games. This was also Walker's final season with the Celtics, as he was traded along with Tony Delk to the Dallas Mavericks the following offseason. He would return to Boston midway during the 2004–05 season.

2012–13 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2012–13 Boston Celtics season was the 67th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Boston Celtics finished the regular season with a 41–40 won-loss record, which was the 3rd best in the Atlantic division, bringing an end to the 5-year run as Atlantic Champs and 7th best in the East. Their longest winning and losing streaks were 7 and 6 games respectively. The leading scorer was Paul Pierce, averaging 18.6 PPG. The leading rebounder was Kevin Garnett (7.8 RPG). Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.1 despite only playing 38 games due to ACL injury. The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway. The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2004–05 season. This season would mark the end of the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett era in Boston as they were traded to the Brooklyn Nets during the 2013 off-season.

2009–10 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2009–10 Boston Celtics season was the 64th season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Celtics finished with a record of 50–32, a 12 win drop off from the previous season. They finished 1st in the Atlantic Division and 4th in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics made it back to the NBA Finals after a one-year hiatus and played against the Los Angeles Lakers. Facing a rematch of the 2008 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the Lakers in six games to capture their seventeenth championship, the Celtics were defeated this time in seven games.

2007–08 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2007–2008 Boston Celtics season was the 62nd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Powered by the acquisitions of perennial All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the offseason, the Celtics finished with a record of 66–16 and posted the best single-season turnaround in NBA history. They finished first in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference, and achieved the league's best record. The 66 wins were also the third-most in franchise history, behind the 1972–73 Celtics’ 68 wins and the famous 1985–86 Celtics’ 67 wins including 40 at home. Kevin Garnett was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, while Danny Ainge, who executed ""the most dramatic NBA turnaround ever"", was named NBA Executive of the Year. The Celtics also sold out all 41 regular-season home games.

2000–01 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2000–01 NBA season was the 55th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired Bryant Stith from the Denver Nuggets. The Celtics played around.500 in November, but then struggled as Kenny Anderson played just 33 games due to an ankle injury and broken jaw. With a 12–22 start to the season, a frustrated Rick Pitino resigned as head coach after three years with the Celtics.

Under replacement Jim O'Brien, they played around.500 for the remainder of the season finishing fifth in the Atlantic Division with a 36–46 record, missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. In the 39 years before the current streak, they had missed the playoffs only five times. Paul Pierce led the team in scoring with 25.3 points per game, and Antoine Walker led the league with 221 three-point field goals. Following the season, Stith signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

1992–93 Boston Celtics season: 
The 1992–93 NBA season was the 47th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. This marked the first season since the 1978–79 season that Hall of Fame player Larry Bird was not on the team. This was also the final season for longtime Celtics All-Star forward Kevin McHale, as he would retire the following offseason. During the offseason, the Celtics signed free agent All-Star forward Xavier McDaniel. However, the team got off to a bad start losing eight of their first ten games, but would post a nine-game winning streak in March to finish second in the Atlantic Division with a solid 48–34 record (only 3 games behind the previous year, when Bird was on the team). The Celtics held home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs against the 5th-seeded Charlotte Hornets, but during Game 1 of the series, All-Star forward Reggie Lewis collapsed on the court (Lewis would never again play in a Celtics uniform, and would die before the next season began). Boston held on to win Game 1, but (minus Lewis) lost the next three games, and thus the series.
