The Burgies: 
The Burgies (or Burgy Bank) are a set of two slag heaps located in the Laffak area of St Helens, Merseyside. The two are divided by Islands Brow road and Snookerpool Avenue and are bordered on the west side by the rail line connecting Liverpool Lime Street with Wigan North Western. They are on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine noted as the first mine to use the revolutionary Anderton shearer-loader. The slag heaps were created by the dumping of toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass by the towns Pilkington company. The exact composition of the slag heaps is unknown but a land study showed it to contain various poisonous elements such as Arsenic, Lead and Cadmium. Technically the land is private property belonging to Pilkington but the public have access and regularly use it for various activities. The exact age of the Burgies is unknown, however it is understood that the second burgies is actually the oldest. This older one is sometimes referred to as ""the dry Burgies"" with the newer first burgies referred to as ""the wet Burgies"". These terms are used by older residents who remember the actual construction, as the first one is a drier waste with the second one being a thick liquid. This liquid was pumped through a pipe from Pilkington’s across the second Burgies to the site of the first Burgies. Boards were erected as moulds to hold the liquid until it dried and then moulds were built on top of these to allow more liquid to be placed on top.
