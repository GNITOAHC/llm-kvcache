Cleopas Ncube: 
Cleopas Ncube (born November 21, 1983) is a Canadian wrestler. He finished in 4th place in the 70kg event at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships, losing the bronze medal final to Ali Shabanau of Belarus. He also ranked among the best in several international competitions, including the Dave Schultz International.

1976–77 Los Angeles Kings season: 
The 1976–77 season was similar to the year before for the Kings. Dionne continued to lead the offense, the defense was unspectacular but solid, but it was a season of roster turnover as some aging veterans departed (e.g. Bob Nevin, Mike Corrigan) and others lost significant time to injuries (Larry Brown, Juha Widing, Sheldon Kannegiesser). Youngsters like Glen Goldup, Lorne Stamler, and Steve Clippingdale struggled although second year defenseman Gary Sargent was solid.
