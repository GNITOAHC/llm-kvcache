Oakhurst (band): 
is a bluegrass-rock band from Denver, CO. Founded by bassist Johnny James Qualley and Singer Adam Patrick Hill in 1999, Oakhurst became a full-time nationally touring act in 2004 and has produced 5 records. Most recently Barrel (2012) which was produced in Nashville, TN by Joe Pisapia. Whether it's in front of thousands of festivarians, hundreds of friendly bar dancers, dozens of fellow pickers, or each other in the studio, Oakhurst leaves it all on the field. This quintet brings their stories to the stage in the form of pure energy and passion for acoustic music. With gifted percussion and a driving low end, the banjo, guitar, fiddle and vocals have all the space they need to tell you a story. Love, life, loss, and whiskey are likely to be the topic of the day- come on and jump in the get down for a spell... The band spikes traditional bluegrass with rock & roll and a kamikaze rhythmic sensibility. That danceable concoction along with stringed shootouts, ringing harmonies, and citybilly swagger keeps the band in high demand. Oakhurst’s unpretentious, go-for-it interpretation of a genre that's roots are often handled reverently, sparks interest in bluegrass by folks who don’t know Doc Watson from Doc Holliday.
