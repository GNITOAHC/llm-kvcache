1,"coach prior to this season. This year's Celtics team was severely hindered by the loss of star forward Larry Bird to a heel injury which required surgery. Bird played only six early-season games before being lost to injury. Initially, Bird was expected back in March, but it was delayed and ultimately became a season-ending injury. The results were dramatic as the Celtics, who had averaged over 60 wins per season thus far in the 1980s, fell to just 42 wins in this season. Coming into the season, the Celtics had been the Eastern Conference's #1 seed five years in a row. This season they were the #8 seed, clinching a playoff spot in the season's final game. This season included some bright spots, particularly the emergence of guard Reggie Lewis, who had been only a minimal bench contributor in his rookie season of 1987-88, but averaged nearly 20 points per game as a starter in 1988-89.

1946–47 Boston Celtics season: 
The 1946–47 Boston Celtics season was the first season of the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA/NBA). Walter A. Brown was the man who was responsible for starting the franchise. On an early June day in 1946, Brown, who operated the Boston Garden arena and was part of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins, was the driving force behind the Basketball Association of America and the Celtics birth. After considering several team names, including Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, Brown opted for Celtics. He hoped to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish American population. John Davis ""Honey"" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59–53 to the Providence Steamrollers. Although the Celtics would eventually become the signature franchise of the NBA, the club had a lacklustre first season as they started with 0 wins and 5 losses. The Celtics won their first game of the season against the Toronto Huskies.

2004–05 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2004–05 NBA season was the 59th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. The season is memorable when the team hired Doc Rivers to be their head coach for the upcoming season. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired All-Star guard Gary Payton, and former Celtics forward Rick Fox from the Los Angeles Lakers, but Fox would retire before the season. The Celtics struggled playing under.500 for the first half of the season. At midseason, Payton was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for former Celtic All-Star forward Antoine Walker. However, Payton would never suit up for the Hawks and was released shortly after. He then re-signed with the Celtics afterwards for the remainder of the season. The team went on a 7-game winning streak in March, finishing first place in the Atlantic Division with a 45–37 record. Paul Pierce was selected for the 2005 NBA All-Star Game.

2002–03 Boston Celtics season: 
The 2002–03 NBA season was the 57th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Celtics acquired Vin Baker from the Seattle SuperSonics. The Celtics posted a six-game winning streak after losing their first two games, and got off to a solid 16–7 start. However, they lost six straight games in March, and finished third in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record. The team made the playoffs for the second time with team captain Paul Pierce, but this time as the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference. Pierce and Antoine Walker were both selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game.
