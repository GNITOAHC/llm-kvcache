Cleopas Ncube: 
Cleopas Ncube (born November 21, 1983) is a Canadian wrestler. He finished in 4th place in the 70kg event at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships, losing the bronze medal final to Ali Shabanau of Belarus. He also ranked among the best in several international competitions, including the Dave Schultz International.

1976–77 Los Angeles Kings season: 
The 1976–77 season was similar to the year before for the Kings. Dionne continued to lead the offense, the defense was unspectacular but solid, but it was a season of roster turnover as some aging veterans departed (e.g. Bob Nevin, Mike Corrigan) and others lost significant time to injuries (Larry Brown, Juha Widing, Sheldon Kannegiesser). Youngsters like Glen Goldup, Lorne Stamler, and Steve Clippingdale struggled although second year defenseman Gary Sargent was solid. The Kings added Dave Schultz (the ""Hammer"") to replace Dan Maloney who left in the Dionne trade for toughness, but it took nearly all season for the roster to jell. In addition, backup goalie Gary Edwards struggled and was eventually traded for Gary Simmons; he was not the answer either, so #1 goalie Rogie Vachon was overworked. The Kings were also stuck behind the Montreal Canadiens who finished an amazing 60–8–12; many say this was the greatest team in NHL history.

Tela O'Donnell: 
Tela O'Donnell (born July 16, 1982 in Homer, Alaska) is a retired amateur American freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. She picked up the 2003 U.S. national runner-up trophy in her respective division, and later represented the United States team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, finishing sixth in the process.

Although the film's action is largely set at Foxcatcher Farm, du Pont's now-broken-up 800-acre suburban Philadelphia estate, the majority of the movie was filmed in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The commission was not received by Lincoln. On March 12, a letter was sent to William H. Seward, Secretary of State of the United States, introducing the commissioners and explaining their peaceful intent. The commission was not received by Seward. On March 15, the commission filed a memorandum which outlined how they had been ignored by Seward and Lincoln. The commissioners were rejected because acceptance of the commission would be recognition of the Confederate States of America.
