St. James was Alig's mentor, rival, and collaborator in the Manhattan party scene, and was familiar with many of its key figures.

Jean-Jacques Eydelie: 
Jean-Jacques Eydelie (born 3 February 1966 in Angoulême, Charente) is a French former footballer most noted for his role in the Marseille match-fixing scandal of 1993. A midfielder, Eydelie began his career with Nantes, before joining Marseille in 1992. His first season at Marseille was a success, with the club finishing top of the league, and winning the Champions League, but shortly after the Champions League final, it was revealed that he had contacted three players at Ligue 1 club Valenciennes (Jorge Burruchaga, Christophe Robert and Jacques Glassman) on behalf of the Marseille board, in order to offer bribes. Marseille needed to beat Valenciennes to secure the championship, and had induced the Valenciennes players to ""go easy"" in order that the Marseille players would not be overly exerted before the Champions League final. It was Glassman who reported the bribe, which resulted in Marseille being stripped of the 1993 French title, banned from defending the Champions League (although the win still stood), and relegated to Ligue 2.
